In The Seven Ha bits of Highly Effective People, he offers us an \\nopportunity, not a how-to guide.

I've had to ask myself -- is it worth it? \\nI've started a new diet -- for the fifth time this year. I know I' m overweight, and I really want to \\nchange. I read all the new information, I set goals, I get myself all psyched up with a positive mental \\nattitude and tell myself I can do it. But I don't. Af ter a few weeks, I fizzle. I just can't seem to keep a \\npromise I make to myself. \\nI've taken course after course on effective mana gement training.  I expect a lot out of my employees \\nand I work hard to be friendly tow ard them and to treat them right. But I don't feel any loyalty from \\nthem. I think if I were home sick for a day, they 'd spend most of their ti me gabbing at the water \\nfountain. Why can't I train them to be independen t and responsible -- or find employees who can be? \\nMy teenage son is rebellious and on drugs. No matter what I try, he won't listen to me. What can \\nI do? \\nThere's so much to do. And there's never enough  time. I feel pressured and hassled all day, every \\nday, seven days a week. I've attended time manageme nt seminars and I've tried half a dozen different \\nplanning systems. They've helped some, but I still don't feel I'm living the happy, productive, peaceful \\nlife I want to live. \\nI want to teach my children the value of work. But to get them to do anything, I have to supervise \\nevery move; and put up with complaining every step of the way. It's so much easier to do it myself. \\nWhy can't children do their work ch eerfully and without being reminded? \\nI'm busy -- really busy. But sometimes I wonder  if what I'm doing will make a difference in the \\nlong run. I'd really like to think there was mean ing in my life, that some how things were different \\nbecause I was here. \\nI see my friends or relatives achieve some degree  of success or receive some  recognition, and I smile \\nand congratulate them enthusiastically. But inside, I' m eating my heart out. Why do I feel this way? \\nI have a forceful personality. I know, in almost  any interaction, I can control the outcome. Most of \\nthe time, I can even do it by influencing others to come up with the solution I want. I think through \\neach situation and I really feel the ideas I come up with are usually the best for everyone. But I feel \\nuneasy. I always wonder what other peop le really think of me and my ideas. \\nMy marriage has gone flat. We don't fight or anything; we just don't lo ve each other anymore. \\nWe've gone to counseling; we've tried a number of th ings, but we just can't seem to rekindle the feeling \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 6}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nwe used to have. \\nThese are deep problems, painful problems -- problems that quick fix approaches can\\'t solve. \\nA few years ago, my wife Sandra and I were strugg ling with this kind of concern. One of our sons \\nwas having a very difficult time in school. He wa s doing poorly academically; he didn\\'t even know \\nhow to follow the instructions on the tests, let alon e do well in them. Socially he was immature, often \\nembarrassing those closest to him. Athletically, he  was small, skinny, and uncoordinated -- swinging \\nhis baseball bat, for example, almost before the ball was even pitched. Others would laugh at him. \\n   Sandra and I were consumed with a desire to help him. We felt th at if \"success\" were important in \\nany area of life, it was supremely im portant in our role as parents. So we worked on our attitudes and \\nbehavior toward him and we tried to work on his. We attempted to psyche him up using positive \\nmental attitude techniques. \"Come on, son! You can do it! We know you can. Put your hands a little \\nhigher on the bat and keep your eye on the ball. Don\\' t swing till it gets close to you.\" And if he did a \\nlittle better, we would go to great lengths to rein force him. \"That\\'s good, son, keep it up.\" \\nWhen others laughed, we reprimanded them. \"Leave him alone. Get off his back. He\\'s just \\nlearning.\" And our son would cry and insist that he\\'d never be any good and that he didn\\'t like baseball \\nanyway. \\nNothing we did seemed to help, and we were rea lly worried. We could see the effect this was \\nhaving on his self-esteem. We tried to be encou raging and helpful and positive, but after repeated \\nfailure, we finally drew back and tried to look at the situation on a different level. \\nAt this time in my professional role I was in volved in leadership development work with various \\nclients throughout the country. In that capacity I was preparing bimonthly pr ograms on the subject of \\ncommunication and perception for IBM\\'s Ex ecutive Development Program participants. \\nAs I researched and prepared these presentati ons, I became particul arly interested in how \\nperceptions are formed, how they behave. This led me to a study of expectancy theory and \\nself-fulfilling prophecies or the \"Pygmalion effect,\"  and to a realization of how deeply imbedded our \\nperceptions are. It taught me that we must look at  the lens through which we see the world, as well as \\nat the world we see, and that the lens it self shapes how we interpret the world. \\nAs Sandra and I talked about the concepts I wa s teaching at IBM and ab out our own situation, we \\nbegan to realize that what we were doing to help our son was not in harmony with the way we really \\nsaw him. When we honestly examined our deepest f eelings, we realized that our perception was that \\nhe was basically inadequate, somehow \"behind.\" No matter how much we worked on our attitude and \\nbehavior, our efforts were ineffective because, de spite our actions and our words, what we really \\ncommunicated to him was, \"You aren\\'t capable. You have to be protected.\" \\nWe began to realize that if we wanted to change  the situation, we first had to change ourselves. \\nAnd to change ourselves effectively, we first had to change our perceptions. \\nThe Personality and Character Ethics \\nAt the same time, in addition to my research on perception, I was also deeply immersed in an \\nin-depth study of the success literature published in  the United States sinc e 1776. I was reading or \\nscanning literally hundreds of books, articles, and es says in fields such as self-improvement, popular \\npsychology, and self-help. At my fingertips was the sum and substance of what a free and democratic \\npeople considered to be the keys to successful living. \\nAs my study took me back through 200 years of  writing about success, I noticed a startling pattern \\nemerging in the content of the literature. Because of our own pain, and because of similar pain I had \\nseen in the lives and relationships of many people I had worked with through the years, I began to feel '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 7}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nmore and more that much of the su ccess literature of the past 50 years was superficial. It was filled \\nwith social image consciousness, techniques and quic k fixes -- with social band-aids and aspirin that \\naddressed acute problems and sometimes even appe ared to solve them temporarily -- but left the \\nunderlying chronic problems untouched to  fester and resurface time and again. \\nIn stark contrast, almost all the literature in th e first 150 years or so focused on what could be called \\nthe character ethic as the foundation of success -- th ings like integrity, humility, fidelity, temperance, \\ncourage, justice, patience, industry, simplicity, mo desty, and the Golden Rule. Benjamin Franklin\\'s \\nautobiography is representative of that literature. It is, basically, the story of one man\\'s effort to \\nintegrate certain principles and habits deep within his nature. \\nThe character ethic taught that there are basic prin ciples of effective living, and that people can only \\nexperience true success and enduring happiness as th ey learn and integrate thes e principles into their \\nbasic character. \\nBut shortly after World War I the basic view of success shifted from the ch aracter ethic to what we \\nmight call the personality ethic. Su ccess became more a function of pe rsonality, of public image, of \\nattitudes and behaviors, skills and techniques, that lubricate the processes of human interaction. This \\npersonality ethic essentially took two paths: one was human and public rela tions techniques, and the \\nother was positive mental attitude (PMA). Some of this philosophy was expressed in inspiring and \\nsometimes valid maxims such as \"Y our attitude determines your alti tude,\" \"Smiling wins more friends \\nthan frowning,\" and \"Whatever the mind of ma n can conceive and believe it can achieve. \\nOther parts of the personality approach were clearly manipulative, even deceptive, encouraging \\npeople to use techniques to get other people to like them, or to fake interest in the hobbies of others to \\nget out of them what they wanted, or to use the \"power look,\" or to intimidate their way through life. \\nSome of this literature acknowledged character as an ingredient of success, but tended to \\ncompartmentalize it rather than reco gnize it as foundational and catalytic. Reference to the character \\nethic became mostly lip service; the basic thrust was quick-fix influence techniques, power strategies, \\ncommunication skills, and positive attitudes. \\nThis personality ethic, I began to realize, wa s the subconscious source of the solutions Sandra and I \\nwere attempting to use with our son. As I thou ght more deeply about the difference between the \\npersonality and character ethics, I realized that Sandra and I had been getting social mileage out of our \\nchildren\\'s good behavior, and, in our eyes, this son simply didn\\'t measure up. Our image of ourselves, \\nand our role as good, caring parents was even deeper  than our image of our son and perhaps influenced \\nit. There was a lot more wrapped up in the wa y we were seeing and handlin g the problem than our \\nconcern for our son\\'s welfare. \\nAs Sandra and I talked, we became painfully aw are of the powerful influence of our character and \\nmotives and of our perception of him. We knew that social comparison mo tives were out of harmony \\nwith our deeper values and could lead to conditional love and eventually to our son\\'s lessened sense of self-worth. So we determined to focus our efforts on us -- not on our techniques, but on our deepest motives and our perception of him. Instead of trying to change him, we tried to stand apart -- to \\nseparate us from him -- and to sense his iden tity, individuality, separateness, and worth. \\nThrough deep thought and the ex ercise of faith and prayer, we began to see our son in terms of his \\nown uniqueness. We saw within him layers and layers of potential that would be realized at his own pace and speed. We decided to relax and get out of  his way and let his own personality emerge. We \\nsaw our natural role as being to affirm, enjoy, and value him. We also conscientiously worked on our \\nmotives and cultivated internal sources of secu rity so that our own feelings of worth were not \\ndependent on our children\\'s \"acceptable\" behavior. \\nAs we loosened up our old perception of our son and developed value-based motives, new feelings \\nbegan to emerge. We found ourselves enjoying him instead of comparing or judging him.  We \\nstopped trying to clone him in our own image or  measure him against social expectations.  We '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nstopped trying to kindly, positively manipulate him into an acceptable social mold. Because we saw \\nhim as fundamentally adequate and able to cope with life, we stopped protecting him against the \\nridicule of others. \\nHe had been nurtured on this protection, so  he went through some withdrawal pains, which he \\nexpressed and which we accepted, but did not necessar ily respond to. \"We don\\'t need to protect you,\" \\nwas the unspoken message. \"You\\'re fundamentally okay.\" \\nAs the weeks and months passed, he began to f eel a quiet confidence and affirmed himself. He \\nbegan to blossom, at his own pace and speed. He be came outstanding as measured by standard social \\ncriteria -- academically, socially and athletically -- at a rapid clip, far beyond the so-called natural \\ndevelopmental process.  As the years passed, he was elected to several student body leadership positions, developed into an all-state athlete and st arted bringing home straight A report cards. He \\ndeveloped an engaging and guileless personality that has enabled him to relate in nonthreatening ways \\nto all kinds of people. \\nSandra and I believe that our son\\'s \"soc ially impressive\" accomplishments were more a \\nserendipitous expression of the fee lings he had about himself than mere ly a response to social reward. \\nThis was an amazing experience for Sandra and me, and a very instructional one in dealing with our \\nother children and in other roles as well. It brought to our awareness on a very personal level the vital \\ndifference between the personality et hic and the character ethic of success. The Psalmist expressed our \\nconviction well: \"Search your own heart with all di ligence for out of it flow the issues of life.\" \\nPrimary and Secondary Greatness \\nM y  e x p e r i e n c e  w i t h  m y  s o n ,  m y  s t u d y  o f  p e rception and my reading of the success literature \\ncoalesced to create one of those \"Aha!\" experiences in  life when suddenly things click into place. I was \\nsuddenly able to see the powerful impact of the person ality ethic and to clearly understand those subtle, \\noften consciously unidentified discrep ancies between what I knew to be true -- some things I had been \\ntaught many years ago as a child and things that were deep in my own inner sense of value -- and the \\nquick fix philosophies that surrounded me every day. I understood at a deeper level why, as I had \\nworked through the years with people from all walks of life, I had found that the things I was teaching \\nand knew to be effective were often at variance with these popular voices. \\nI am not suggesting that elements of the pers onality ethic -- personality growth, communication skill \\ntraining, and education in the field of influence strat egies and positive thinking -- are not beneficial, in \\nfact sometimes essential for success. I believe they are. But these are secondary, not primary traits. \\nPerhaps, in utilizing our human capacity to build on the foundation of generations before us, we have \\ninadvertently become so focused on  our own building that we have forgotten the foundation that holds \\nit up; or in reaping for so long where we have not sown, perhaps we have forgotten the need to sow. \\nIf I try to use human influence strategies and tactics of how to get other people to do what I want, to \\nwork better, to be more motivated, to like me and each other -- while my character is fundamentally \\nflawed, marked by duplicity and insincerity -- then , in the long run, I cannot be successful. My \\nduplicity will breed distrust, and everything I do  -- even using so-called good human relations \\ntechniques -- will be perceived as manipulative. It  simply makes no difference how good the rhetoric \\nis or even how good the intentions are; if there is little or no trust, there is no foundation for permanent \\nsuccess. Only basic goodness gives life to technique. \\nTo focus on technique is like cramming your  way through school. You sometimes get by, perhaps \\neven get good grades, but if you don\\'t pay the price day in and day out, you never achieve true mastery \\nof the subjects you study or develop an educated mind. \\nDid you ever consider how ridiculous it would be to  try to cram on a farm -- to forget to plant in the \\nspring, play all summer and then cram in the fall to br ing in the harvest? The f arm is a natural system.

You always reap what you sow; there is no shortcut. \\nThis principle is also true, ultimately, in huma n behavior, in human relationships. They, too, are \\nnatural systems based on the The Law of the Harvest. In the short run, in an artifi cial social system such \\nas school, you may be able to get by if you learn ho w to manipulate the man-made rules, to \"play the \\ngame.\" In most one-shot or short-lived human intera ctions, you can use the personality ethic to get by \\nand to make favorable impressions through charm an d skill and pretending to be interested in other \\npeople\\'s hobbies. You can pick up quick, easy tech niques that may work in short-term situations. \\nBut secondary traits alone have no permanent worth in long-term relationships. Eventually, if there \\nisn\\'t deep integrity and fundamental character strength , the challenges of life w ill cause true motives to \\nsurface and human relationship failu re will replace short-term success. \\nMany people with secondary greatness -- that is , social recognition for their talents -- lack primary \\ngreatness or goodness in their character. Sooner or later, you\\'ll see this in every long-term relationship \\nthey have, whether it is with a business associate, a spouse, a friend, or a teenage child going through \\nan identity crisis. It is character that communicate s most eloquently. As Em erson once put it, \"What \\nyou are shouts so loudly in my ears that I cannot hear what you say.\" \\nThere are, of course, situations where people have character strength but they lack communication \\nskills, and that undoubtedly affects the quality of relationships as well.  But the effects are still \\nsecondary. \\nIn the last analysis, what we are communicates far more eloquently than anything we say or do. \\nWe all know it. There are people we trust abso lutely because we know their character. Whether \\nthey\\'re eloquent or not, whether they have the human relations tec hniques or not, we trust them, and \\nwe work successfully with them. \\nIn the words of William George Jordan, \"Into th e hands of every individual is given a marvelous \\npower for good or evil -- the silent unconscious, un seen influence of his life. This is simply the \\nconstant radiation of what man really  is, not what he pretends to be.\" \\nThe Power of a Paradigm \\nThe Seven Habits of Highly Effective People embody many of the fundamental principles of human \\neffectiveness. These habits are basic; they are pr imary. They represent the internalization of correct \\nprinciples upon which enduring happiness and success are based. \\nBut before we can really understand these Seven Habits TM, we need to understand our own \\n\"paradigms\" and how to make a \"A Paradigm Shift TM.\" \\nBoth the The Character Ethic The Personality Ethi c are examples of social paradigms. The word \\nparadigm comes from the Greek. It was originally a scientific term, and is more commonly used today \\nto mean a model, theory, perception, assumption, or fr ame of reference. In the more general sense, it\\'s \\nthe way we \"see\" the world -- not in terms of our vi sual sense of sight, but in terms of perceiving, \\nunderstanding, and interpreting. \\nFor our purposes, a simple way to understand para digms is to see them as maps. We all know that \\n\"the map is not the territory.\" A map is simply an e xplanation of certain aspects of the territory. That\\'s \\nexactly what a paradigm is. It is a theory, an explanation, or model of something else. \\nSuppose you wanted to arrive at a specific locati on in central Chicago. A street map of the city \\nwould be a great help to you in reaching your destination. But suppose you were given the wrong \\nmap. Through a printing error, the map labeled \"Chicago\" was actually a map of Detroit. Can you \\nimagine the frustration, the ineffectivene ss of trying to reach your destination? \\nYou might work on your behavior -- you could try harder, be more diligent, double your speed. \\nBut your efforts would only succeed in getting you to the wrong place faster. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 10}, page_content=\"T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nYou might work on your attitude -- you could th ink more positively. You still wouldn't get to the \\nright place, but perhaps you wouldn't care. Your  attitude would be so positive, you'd be happy \\nwherever you were. \\nThe point is, you'd still be lost. The fundamental  problem has nothing to do with your behavior or \\nyour attitude.  It has everything to do with having a wrong map. \\nIf you have the right map of Chicago, then diligence becomes important, and when you encounter \\nfrustrating obstacles along the way, then attitude can make a real difference. But the first and most \\nimportant requirement is the accuracy of the map. \\nEach of us has many, many maps in our head, which can be divided into two main categories: maps \\nof the way things are, or realities, and maps of th e way things should be, or values. We interpret \\neverything we experience through these mental maps .  We seldom question  their accuracy; we're \\nusually even unaware that we have them. We simp ly assume that the way we see things is the way \\nthey really are or the way they should be. \\nAnd our attitudes and behaviors grow out of those assumptions.  The way we see things is the \\nsource of the way we think and the way we act. \\nBefore going any further, I invite you to have an intellectual and emotional experience. Take a few \\nseconds and just look at the picture on the following page \\nNow look at the picture below and carefully describe what you see \\nDo you see a woman? How old would you say she is? What does she look like? What is she wearing? \\nIn what kind of roles do you see her? \\nYou probably would describe the woman in the second picture to be about 25 years old -- very \\nlovely, rather fashionable with a petite nose and demure presence. If you were a single man you might like to take her out. If you were in retailing, you might hire her as a fashion model. \\nBut what if I were to tell you that you're wrong? Wh at if I said this picture is of a woman in her 60s \\nor 70s who looks sad, has a huge nose, and certainly is no model. She's someone you probably would \\nhelp cross the street. \\nWho's right? Look at the pict ure again. Can you see the old woma n? If you can't, keep trying. \\nCan you see her big hook nose? Her shawl? \\nIf you and I were talking face to face, we coul d discuss the picture. You could describe what you \\nsee to me, and I could talk to you about what I s ee. We could continue to communicate until you \\nclearly showed me what you see in the picture and I clearly showed you what I see. \\nBecause we can't do that, turn to page 45 and st udy the picture there and th en look at this picture \\nagain. Can you see the old woman now? It's important that you see her before you continue reading. \\nI first encountered this exercise many years ag o at the Harvard Business School. The instructor was \\nusing it to demonstrate clearly and eloquently that two people can see the same thing, disagree, and yet both be right. It's not logical; it's psychological. \\nHe brought into the room a stack of large card s, half of which had the image of the young woman \\nyou saw on page 25, and the other half of which had the old woman on page 45. \\nHe passed them out to the class, the picture of  the young woman to one side of the room and the \\npicture of the old woman to the other. He asked us to  look at the cards, conc entrate on them for about \\n10 seconds and then pass them back in. He then projected upon the screen the picture you saw on \\npage 26 combining both images and asked the class to  describe what they saw. Almost every person \\nin that class who had first seen the young woma n's image on a card saw the young woman in the \\npicture. And almost every person in that class who had first seen the old woman's image on a card \\nsaw an old woman in the picture. \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 11}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nThe professor then asked one student to explain what he saw to a student on the opposite side of the \\nroom. As they talked back and fort h, communication problems flared up. \\n\"What do you mean, \\'old lady\\'? She co uldn\\'t be more than 20 or 22 years old! \\n\"Oh, come on. You have to be joking. She\\'s 70 -- could be pushing 80!\" \\n   \"What\\'s the matter with you?  Are you blind?  Th is lady is young, good looking. I\\'d like to take \\nher out.  She\\'s lovely.\" \\n\"Lovely? She\\'s an old hag. \\nThe arguments went back and forth, each person  sure of, and adamant in, his or her position. All \\nof this occurred in spite of one exceedingly important advantage the students had -- most of them knew \\nearly in the demonstration that another point of view did, in fact, exist -- something many of us would \\nnever admit. Nevertheless, at first, only a few stud ents really tried to see this picture from another \\nframe of reference. \\nAfter a period of futile communication, one st udent went up to the screen and pointed to a line on \\nthe drawing. \"There is the young woman\\'s necklace.\"  The other one said, \"No, that is the old woman\\'s \\nmouth.\" Gradually, they began to calmly discuss specif ic points of difference, and finally one student, \\nand then another, experienced sudden recognition when the images of bo th came into focus. Through \\ncontinued calm, respectful, and specific communication,  each of us in the room was finally able to see \\nthe other point of view. But when  we looked away and then back, mo st of us would immediately see \\nthe image we had been conditioned to s ee in the 10-second period of time. \\nI frequently use this perception demonstration in working with people an d organizations because it \\nyields so many deep insights into both personal and interpersonal effectiveness. It shows, first of all, \\nhow powerfully conditioning affects our perceptions, our paradigms. If 10 seconds can have that kind \\nof impact on the way we see things, what about the conditioning of a lifetime? The influences in our \\nlives -- family, school, church, work environment, friends, associates, and current social paradigms such \\nas the personality ethic -- all have made their silent  unconscious impact on us and help shape our frame \\nof reference, our paradigms, our maps. \\nIt also shows that these paradigms are the sour ce of our attitudes and behaviors. We cannot act \\nwith integrity outside of them. We simply cannot maintain wholeness if we talk and walk differently \\nthan we see. If you were among the 90 percent who typically see the young woman in the composite \\npicture when conditioned to do so, you undoubtedly fo und it difficult to think in terms of having to \\nhelp her cross the street. Both your attitude ab out her and your behavior toward her had to be \\ncongruent with the way you saw her. \\nThis brings into focus one of the basic flaws of  the personality ethic. To try to change outward \\nattitudes and behaviors does very little good in th e long run if we fail to examine the basic paradigms \\nfrom which those attitudes and behaviors flow. \\nThis perception demonstration also shows ho w powerfully our paradigms affect the way we interact \\nwith other people. As clearly and objectively as we think we see things, we begin to realize that others \\nsee them differently from their own apparently equa lly clear and objective point of view. \"Where we \\nstand depends on where we sit.\" \\nEach of us tends to think we see things as they are, that we are objective. But this is not the case. \\nWe see the world, not as it is, but as we are -- or, as we are conditioned to see it. When we open our \\nmouths to describe what we see, we in effect desc ribe ourselves, our perceptions, our paradigms. \\nWhen other people disagree with us, we immediately th ink something is wrong with them. But, as the \\ndemonstration shows, sincere, clearheaded people see things differently, each looking through the \\nunique lens of experience. \\nThis does not mean that there are no facts. In the demonstration, two individuals who initially \\nhave been influenced by different conditioning pict ures look at the third pi cture together.  They are '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nnow both looking at the same iden tical facts -- black lines and whit e spaces -- and they would both \\nacknowledge these as facts. But each person\\'s interp retation of these facts repr esents prior experiences, \\nand the facts have no meaning whatso ever apart from the interpretation. \\nThe more aware we are of our basic paradigms, ma ps, or assumptions, and the extent to which we \\nhave been influenced by our experience, the mo re we can take responsibility for those paradigms, \\nexamine them, test them against reality, listen to others and be open to th eir perceptions, thereby \\ngetting a larger picture and a far more objective view. \\nThe Power of a Paradigm Shift \\nPerhaps the most important insight to be gained from the perception demonstration is in the area of \\nparadigm shifting, what we might call the \"Aha!\" experience when someone finally \"sees\" the composite \\npicture in another way. The more bound a person is by the initial perception, the more powerful the \\n\"Aha!\" experience is. It\\'s as though a light were suddenly turned on inside. \\nThe term Paradigm Shift was introduced by Thom as Kuhn in his highly influential landmark book, \\nThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Kuhn show s how almost every significant breakthrough in the \\nfield of scientific endeavor is first a break with tradition, with old ways of th inking, with old paradigms. \\nFor Ptolemy, the great Egyptian astronomer, the earth was the center of the universe.  But \\nCopernicus created a Paradigm Shift, and a great deal of resistance and persecution as well, by placing \\nthe sun at the center. Suddenly, everyth ing took on a different interpretation. \\nThe Newtonian model of physics was a cloc kwork paradigm and is still the basis of modern \\nengineering. But it was partial, incomplete.  The scientific world was revolutionized by the \\nEinsteinian paradigm, the relativity paradigm, whic h had much higher predictive and explanatory \\nvalue. \\n   Until the germ theory was de veloped, a high percentage of women and children died during \\nchildbirth, and one could understand why. In m ilitary skirmishes, more men were dying from small \\nwounds and diseases than from the major traumas on the front lines. But as soon as the germ theory \\nwas developed, a whole new paradigm, a better, improved way of understanding what was happening made dramatic, significant medical improvement possible. \\nThe United States today is the fruit of a Paradigm Shift. The traditional concept of government for \\ncenturies had been a monarchy, the divine right of kings. Then a different paradigm was developed -\\xad\\ngovernment of the people, by the people, and for the people. And a constitutional democracy was born, unleashing tremendous human energy and inge nuity, and creating a standard of living, of \\nfreedom and liberty, of influence and hope unequaled in the history of the world. \\nNot all Paradigm Shifts are in positive direct ions.  As we have observed, the shift from the \\ncharacter ethic to the personality ethic has drawn us aw ay from the very roots that nourish true success \\nand happiness. \\nBut whether they shift us in positive or nega tive directions, whether they are instantaneous or \\ndevelopmental, Paradigm Shifts move us from one way of seeing the world to another. And those \\nshifts create powerful change. Our paradigms, correct  or incorrect, are the sources of our attitudes and \\nbehaviors, and ultimately our relationships with others. \\nI remember a mini-Paradigm Shift I experienced one Sunday morning on a subway in New York. \\nPeople were sitting quietly -- some reading newspapers, some lost in thought, some resting with their \\neyes closed. It was a calm, peaceful scene. \\nThen suddenly, a man and his children entered the subway car. The children were so loud and \\nrambunctious that instantly the whole climate changed. \\nThe man sat down next to me and closed his eyes, apparently oblivious to the situation. The \\nchildren were yelling back and forth, throwing things , even grabbing people\\'s papers. It was very '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 13}, page_content='I T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\ndisturbing. And yet, the man sitting next to me did nothing. \\nIt was difficult not to feel irritated. I could not believe that he could be  so insensitive to let his \\nchildren run wild like that and do no thing about it, taking no responsib ility at all. It was easy to see \\nthat everyone else on the subway felt irritated, too. So finally, with what I felt was unusual patience \\nand restraint, I turned to him and said, \"Sir, your children are really disturbing a lot of people. \\nwonder if you couldn\\'t control them a little more?\" \\nThe man lifted his gaze as if to come to a con sciousness of the situation fo r the first time and said \\nsoftly, \"Oh, you\\'re right. I guess I should do something about it. We just came from the hospital \\nwhere their mother died about an hour ago. I don\\' t know what to think, an d I guess they don\\'t know \\nhow to handle it either.\" \\nCan you imagine what I felt at that mome nt? My paradigm shifted.  Suddenly I saw things \\ndifferently, I felt differently, I behaved differently. My irritation vanished. I didn\\'t have to worry \\nabout controlling my attitude or my behavior; my he art was filled with the man\\'s pain. Feelings of \\nsympathy and compassion flowed freely. \"Your wi fe just died? Oh, I\\'m so sorry. Can you tell me \\nabout it? What can I do to help?\" Everything changed in an instant. \\nMany people experience a similar fundamental sh ift in thinking when they face a life-threatening \\ncrisis and suddenly see their priorities in a different light, or when they sudden ly step into a new role, \\nsuch as that of husband or wife, pare nt or grandparent, manager or leader. \\nWe could spend weeks, months, even years labori ng with the personality ethic trying to change our \\nattitudes and behaviors and not even begin to approach the phenomenon of change that occurs spontaneously when we see things differently. \\nIt becomes obvious that if we want to make relatively minor changes in our lives, we can perhaps \\nappropriately focus on our attitudes and behaviors. But if we want to make significant, quantum \\nchange, we need to work on our basic paradigms. \\nIn the words of Thoreau, \"For every thousand hack ing at the leaves of evil, there is one striking at \\nthe root.\" We can only achieve quantum improvements in our lives as we quit hacking at the leaves of \\nattitude and behavior and get to work on the root, the paradigms from which our attitudes and \\nbehaviors flow. \\nSeeing and Being \\nOf course, not all Paradigm Shifts are instantaneous. Unlike my instant in sight on the subway, the \\nparadigm-shifting experience Sandra and I had wi th our son was a slow, difficult, and deliberate \\nprocess. The approach we had first taken with him was the outgrowth of years of conditioning and \\nexperience in the personality ethic. It was the result of deeper paradigms we held about our own \\nsuccess as parents as well as the me asure of success of our children. And it was not until we changed \\nthose basic paradigms, quantum change in ourselves and in the situation. \\nIn order to see our son differently, Sandra an d I had to be differently. Our new paradigm was \\ncreated as we invested in the growth  and development of our own character. \\nOur Paradigms are the way we \"see\" the world or ci rcumstances -- not in term s of our visual sense of \\nsight, but in terms of perceiving, understanding,  and interpreting. Paradigms are inseparable from \\ncharacter. Being is seeing in the human dimension. And what we see is high ly interrelated to what \\nwe are. We can\\'t go very far to change our seeing  without simultaneously changing our being, and \\nvice versa. \\nEven in my apparently instantaneous paradigm- shifting experience that  morning on the subway, \\nmy change of vision was a result of  -- and limited by -- my basic character. \\nI\\'m sure there are people who, even suddenly un derstanding the true situation, would have felt no \\nmore than a twinge of regret or vague guilt as they continued to sit in embarrassed silence beside the '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 14}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\ngrieving, confused man. On the other hand, I am equally certain there are people who would have \\nbeen far more sensitive in the first place, who may have recognized that a deeper problem existed and \\nreached out to understand and help before I did. \\nParadigms are powerful because they create th e lens through which we see the world. The power \\nof a Paradigm Shift is the essential power of quantum change, whether that shift is an instantaneous or \\na slow and deliberate process. \\nThe Principle-Centered Paradigm \\nThe character ethic is based on the fundamental idea that there are principles that govern human \\neffectiveness -- natural laws in the human dimension that are just as real, just as unchanging and \\nunarguably \"there\" as laws such as gravity are in the physical dimension. \\nAn idea of the reality -- and the impact -- of these principles can be captured in another \\nparadigm-shifting experience as told by Frank Kock in Proceedi ngs, the magazine of the Naval \\nInstitute. \\nTwo battleships assigned to the training squadr on had been at sea on maneuvers in heavy weather \\nfor several days. I was serving on the lead battleshi p and was on watch on the bridge as night fell. \\nThe visibility was poor with patchy fog, so the capt ain remained on the bridge  keeping an eye on all \\nactivities. \\nShortly after dark, the lookout on the wing of the bridge reported, \"Light, bearing on the starboard \\nbow.\" \\n\"Is it steady or moving astern?\" the captain called out. \\nLookout replied, \"Steady, captain,\" which meant we were on a dangerous collision course with that \\nship. \\nThe captain then called to the signal man, \"Signal that ship: We are on a collision course, advise you \\nchange course 20 degrees.\" \\nBack came a signal, \"Advisable for you to change course 20 degrees.\" \\nThe captain said, \"Send, I\\'m a captain, change course 20 degrees.\" \\n\"I\\'m a seaman second class,\" came the reply. \"You had better change course 20 degrees.\" \\nBy that time, the captain was furious. He spat  out, \"Send, I\\'m a battleship. Change course 20 \\ndegrees.\"    Back came the flashing  light, \"I\\'m a lighthouse.\" \\n   We changed course \\nThe A Paradigm Shift is the \"a-h a\" experience associated with fi nally perceiving or understanding \\nsome aspect of the world (or a ci rcumstance) in a different way. Paradigm Shift experienced by the \\ncaptain -- and by us as we read this account -- puts th e situation in a totally different light. We can see \\na reality that is superseded by his limited perceptions -- a reality that is as critical for us to understand \\nin our daily lives as it was for the captain in the fog. \\n   Principles are like lighthouses.  They are natural  laws that cannot be broken. As Cecil B. deMille \\nobserved of the principles contained in his monumental movie, The Ten Commandments, \"It is impossible for us to break the law. We can only break ourselves against the law.\" \\nWhile individuals may look at their own lives  and interactions in terms of paradigms or maps \\nemerging out of their experience  and conditioning, these maps are  not the territory.  They are a \\n\"subjective reality,\" only an attempt to describe the territory. \\nThe \"objective reality,\" or the territory itself, is composed of \"lighthouse\" principles that govern \\nhuman growth and happiness -- natural laws that are woven into the fabric of every civilized society \\nthroughout history and comprise the roots of ev ery family and institution that has endured and \\nprospered. The degree to which our mental maps accurately describe the territory does not alter its '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 15}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nexistence. \\nThe reality of such principles or natural laws  becomes obvious to anyone who thinks deeply and \\nexamines the cycles of social history. These princi ples surface time and time again, and the degree to \\nwhich people in society recognize and live in harmon y with them moves them toward either survival \\nand stability or disintegration and destruction. \\nThe principles I am referring to are not esoteric , mysterious, or \"religious\" ideas. There is not one \\nprinciple taught in this book that is unique to any specific faith or religion, including my own. These \\nprinciples are a part of every major enduring relig ion, as well as enduring social philosophies and \\nethical systems. They are self-evident and can easily be validated by any individual. It\\'s almost as if \\nthese principles or natural laws are part of the huma n condition, part of the human consciousness, part \\nof the human conscience. They seem to exist in all human beings, regardless of social conditioning and \\nloyalty to them, even though they might be subm erged or numbed by conditions or disloyalty. \\nI am referring, for example, to the principle of  fairness, out of which our whole concept of equity \\nand justice is developed. Little children seem to have  an innate sense of the idea of fairness even apart \\nfrom opposite conditioning experiences. There are vast differences in how fairness is defined and achieved, but there is almost universal awareness of the idea. \\nOther examples would include integrity and honesty. They create the foundation of trust which is \\nessential to cooperation and long-ter m personal and interpersonal growth. \\nAnother principle is human dignity.  The ba sic concept in the United States Declaration of \\nIndependence bespeaks this value or principle. \"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men \\nare created equal and endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\" \\nAnother principle is service, or the idea of maki ng a contribution. Another is quality or excellence. \\nThere is the principle of potential, the idea  that we are embryonic and can grow and develop and \\nrelease more and more potential, develop more and mo re talents. Highly related to potential is the \\nprinciple of growth -- the process of releasing potent ial and developing talents,  with the accompanying \\nneed for principles such as patience, nurturance, and encouragement. \\nPrinciples are not practices. A practice is a spec ific activity or action. A practice that works in one \\ncircumstance will not necessarily work in another, as  parents who have tried to raise a second child \\nexactly like they did the first one can readily attest. \\nWhile practices are situationally specific, principl es are deep, fundamental tr uths that have universal \\napplication. They apply to individuals, to marriages , to families, to private an d public organizations of \\nevery kind. When these truths are internalized in to habits, they empower people to create a wide \\nvariety of practices to deal with different situations. \\nWhile practices are situationally specific, principl es are deep, fundamental tr uths that have universal \\napplication.

A gang of thieves can share values, but they are in violation of the \\nfundamental principles we\\'re talking about. Principl es are the territory. Valu es are maps. When we \\nvalue correct principles, we have truth -- a knowledge of things as they are. \\nPrinciples are guidelines for human conduct that  are proven to have enduring, permanent value. \\nThey\\'re fundamental. They\\'re esse ntially unarguable because they are self-evident.  One way to \\nquickly grasp the self-evident nature of principles is  to simply consider the absurdity of attempting to \\nlive an effective life based on their opposites. I do ubt that anyone would seriously consider unfairness, \\ndeceit, baseness, uselessness, mediocrity, or degenerat ion to be a solid foundati on for lasting happiness \\nand success.  Although people ma y argue about how these principles  are defined or manifested or \\nachieved, there seems to be an innate co nsciousness and awareness that they exist.

Correct ma ps will infinitely impact our personal and \\ninterpersonal effectiveness far more than any amount of effort expended on changing our attitudes and \\nbehaviors. \\nPrinciples of Growth and Change \\n   The glitter of the personality et hic, the massive appeal, is that th ere is some quick and easy way to \\nachieve quality of life -- personal e ffectiveness and rich, deep relation ships with other people -- without \\ngoing through the natural process of wo rk and growth that makes it possible \\n   It\\'s symbol without substance.  It\\'s the \"get  rich quick\" scheme promising \"wealth without work.\" \\nAnd it might even appear to succ eed -- but the schemer remains. \\nThe personality ethic is illusory and deceptive. And trying to get high-quality results with its \\ntechniques and quick fixes is just about as effective as trying to get to some  place in Chicago using a \\nmap of Detroit. \\nIn the words of Erich Fromm, an astute observer  of the roots and fruits of the personality ethic. \\nToday we come across an individual who beha ves like an automaton, who does not know or \\nunderstand himself, and the only person that he knows is the person that he is supposed to be, whose \\nmeaningless chatter has replaced communicative sp eech, whose synthetic smile has replaced genuine \\nlaughter, and whose sense of dull despair has taken th e place of genuine pain. Two statements may be \\nsaid concerning this individual. One is that he suffers from defects of spontaneity and individuality \\nwhich may seem to be incurable. At  the same time it may be said of him he does not differ essentially \\nfrom the millions of the rest of us who walk upon this earth. \\nIn all of life, there are sequential stages of gr owth and development. A child learns to turn over, to \\nsit up, to crawl, and then to walk and run. Each step is important and each one takes time. No step \\ncan be skipped. \\nThis is true in all phases of life, in all areas of development, whether it be learning to play the piano \\nor communicate effectively with a working associate. It is true with individuals, with marriages, with \\nfamilies, and with organizations. \\nWe know and accept this fact or principle of process in the area of physical things, but to understand \\nit in emotional areas, in human relations, and even  in the area of personal character is less common and \\nmore difficult. And even if we unde rstand it, to accept it and to live in harmony with it are even less \\ncommon and more difficult. Consequently, we sometime s look for a shortcut, expecting to be able to \\nskip some of these vital steps in order to save time and effort and still reap the desired result. \\nBut what happens when we attempt to shortcut a natural process in our growth and development? \\nIf you are only an average tennis player but decide to  play at a higher level in order to make a better \\nimpression, what will result? Would positive thinking alone enable you to comp ete effectively against a \\nprofessional? \\nWhat if you were to lead your friends to believe  you could play the piano at concert hall level while \\nyour actual present skill was that of a beginner? \\nThe answers are obvious. It is simply impossibl e to violate, ignore, or shortcut this development \\nprocess. It is contrary to nature, and attempting to  seek such a shortcut only  results in disappointment \\nand frustration. \\nOn a 10-point scale, if I am at level two in any fiel d, and desire to move to level five, I must first take \\nthe step toward level three. \"A thousand-mile journe y begins with the first step\" and can only be taken \\none step at a time.

You cannot pretend for long, for you will eventually be found \\nout. Admission of ignorance is often the first step  in our education. Thoreau taught, \"How can we \\nremember our ignorance, which ou r growth requires, when we are using our knowledge all of the \\ntime?\" \\nI recall one occasion when two young women, daug hters of a friend of mine, came to me tearfully, \\ncomplaining about their father\\'s harshness and lack of understanding. They were afraid to open up \\nwith their parents for fear of the consequences. An d yet they desperately needed their parents\\' love, \\nunderstanding, and guidance. \\nI talked with the father and found that he was intellectually aware of what was happening.  But \\nwhile he admitted he had a temper problem, he refused to take responsibility for it and to honestly \\naccept the fact that his emotional development le vel was low. It was more than his pride could \\nswallow to take the first step toward change. \\nTo relate effectively with a wife, a husband, ch ildren, friends, or working associates, we must learn \\nto listen. And this requires emotional strength. Listening involves patience , openness, and the desire \\nto understand -- highly developed qualities of charact er. It\\'s so much easier to operate from a low \\nemotional level and to give high-level advice. \\nOur level of development is fairly obvious with  tennis or piano playing, where it is impossible to \\npretend. But it is not so obvious in the areas of  character and emotional development. We can \"pose\" \\nand \"put on\" for a stranger or an associate. We can pretend. And for a while we can get by with it -\\xad\\nat least in public. We might even deceive ourselves. Yet I believe that most of us know the truth of \\nwhat we really are inside; and I think many of those we live with and work with do as well. \\nI have seen the consequences of attempting to shortcut this natural process of growth often in the \\nbusiness world, where executives attempt to \"buy\" a new culture of improved productivity, quality, \\nmorale, and customer service with the strong speeche s, smile training, and external interventions, or \\nthrough mergers, acquisitions, and friendly or unfr iendly takeovers. But they ignore the low-trust \\nclimate produced by such manipulations.  When  these methods don\\'t work, they look for other \\npersonality ethic techniques that will -- all the time ignoring and vi olating the natural principles and \\nprocesses on which high-trust culture is based. \\nI remember violating this principle myself as a father many years ago. One day I returned home to \\nmy little girl\\'s third-year birthday party to find her in the corner of  the front room, defiantly clutching \\nall of her presents, unwilling to let the other childre n play with them. The first thing I noticed was \\nseveral parents in the room witnessi ng this selfish display. I was embarrassed, and doubly so because \\nat the time I was teaching university classes in human relations. And I knew, or at least felt, the \\nexpectation of these parents. \\nThe atmosphere in the room was really ch arged -- the children were crowding around my little \\ndaughter with their hands out, asking to play with the presents they had just  given, and my daughter \\nwas adamantly refusing. I said to myself, \"Certainly  I should teach my daughter to share. The value \\nof sharing is one of the most  basic things we believe in.\" \\nSo I first tried a simple request. \"Honey, would you please share with your friends the toys they\\'ve \\ngiven you? \\n   \"No,\" she replied flatly. \\nMy second method was to use a little reasoning. \"Honey, if you learn to sh are your toys with them \\nwhen they are at your home, then  when you go to their homes they  will share their toys with you.\" \\nAgain, the immediate reply was \"No!\" \\nI was becoming a little more embarrassed, for it was evident I was having no influence. The third \\nmethod was bribery. Very softly I said, \"Honey, if  you share, I\\'ve got special surprise for you. I\\'ll '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 18}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\ngive you a piece of gum.\" \\n\"I don\\'t want gum!\" she exploded. \\nNow I was becoming exasperated. For my fourth  attempt, I resorted to fear and threat. \"Unless \\nyou share, you will be in real trouble!\" \\n   \"I don\\'t care!\" she cried.  \"These are my things. I don\\'t have to share!\" \\nFinally, I resorted to force. I merely took some of the toys and gave them to the other kids. \"Here, \\nkids, play with these.\" \\nBut at that moment, I valued the opinion those parents had of  me more than the growth and \\ndevelopment of my child and our relationship togethe r. I simply made an initial judgment that I was \\nright; she should share, and she was wrong in not doing so. \\nPerhaps I superimposed a higher-level expectatio n on her simply because on my own scale I was at \\na lower level. I was unable or unwilling to give patience or understanding, so I expected her to give \\nthings. In an attempt to compensate for my deficiency, I borrowed strength  f r o m  m y  p o s i t i o n  a n d \\nauthority and forced her to do what I wanted her to do. \\n   But borrowing strength builds weakness.  It builds weakness in the borrower because it reinforces \\ndependence on external factors to get things do ne.  It builds weakness in  the person forced to \\nacquiesce, stunting the development of independent reasoning, growth , and internal discipline. And \\nfinally, it builds weakness in the relationship. Fear replaces cooperation, and both people involved \\nbecome more arbitrary and defensive. \\nAnd what happens when the source of borrowed strength -- be it superior size or physical strength, \\nposition, authority, credentials, status symbols, appearance, or past achievements -- changes or is no longer there? \\nHad I been more mature, I could have relied on  my own intrinsic strength -- my understanding of \\nsharing and of growth and my capacity to love and nurture -- and allowed my daughter to make a free \\nchoice as to whether she wanted to share or not to share. Perhaps after attempting to reason with her, \\nI could have turned the attention of the children to  an interesting game, taking all that emotional \\npressure off my child. I\\'ve learned that once child ren gain a sense of real possession, they share very \\nnaturally, freely, and spontaneously. \\n   My experience has been that there are times to teach and times not to teach. When relationships \\nare strained and the air charged with emotion, an a ttempt to teach is often perceived as a form of \\njudgment and rejection. But to take the child alon e, quietly, when the rela tionship is good and to \\ndiscuss the teaching or the value seems to have mu ch greater impact. It may have been that the \\nemotional maturity to do that was beyond my leve l of patience and internal control at the time. \\nPerhaps a sense of possessing needs to come be fore a sense of genuine sh aring.  Many people who \\ngive mechanically or refuse to give and share in their marriages and families may never have \\nexperienced what it means to possess themselves, th eir own sense of identity and self-worth. Really \\nhelping our children grow may involv e being patient enough to allow them the sense of possession as \\nwell as being wise enough to teach them the valu e of giving and providing the example ourselves. \\nThe Way We See the Problem is the Problem \\nPeople are intrigued when they see good things happening in the lives of individuals, families, and \\norganizations that are based on solid principles. They admire such personal strength and maturity, \\nsuch family unity and teamwork, such adap tive synergistic organizational culture. \\nAnd their immediate request is very revealing of  their basic paradigm. \"How do you do it? Teach \\nme the techniques.\" What they\\'re really saying is, \"Give me some quic k fix advice or solution that will \\nrelieve the pain in my own situation.\" '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 19}, page_content=\"T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nThey will find people who will meet their wants and teach these things; and for a short time, skills \\nand techniques may appear to work.

I expect a lot out of my employees \\nand I work hard to be friendly tow ard them and to treat them right. But I don't feel any loyalty from \\nthem. I think if I were home sick for a day, they 'd spend most of their ti me gabbing at the water \\nfountain. Why can't I train them to be independen t and responsible -- or find employees who can be? \\nThe personality ethic tells me I could take some  kind of dramatic action -- shake things up, make \\nheads roll -- that would make my employees shape up and appreciate what they have. Or that I could \\nfind some motivational training program that woul d get them committed. Or even that I could hire \\nnew people that would do a better job. \\nBut is it possible that under that apparently disloyal behavior, these em ployees question whether I \\nreally act in their best interest? Do they feel like I' m treating them as mechanical objects? Is there some \\ntruth to that? \\nDeep inside, is that really the way I see them? Is there a chance the way I look at the people who \\nwork for me is part of the problem? \\nThere's so much to do. And there's never enough  time. I feel pressured and hassled all day, every \\nday, seven days a week. I've attended time manageme nt seminars and I've tried half a dozen different \\nplanning systems. They've helped some, but I still don't feel I'm living the happy, productive, peaceful \\nlife I want to live. \\nThe personality ethic tells me there must be something out there -- some  new planner or seminar \\nthat will help me handle all these pressures in a more efficient way. \\nBut is there a chance that effi ciency is not the answer? Is getting more things done in less time going \\nto make a difference -- or will it just increase the pace at which I react to the people and circumstances \\nthat seem to control my life? \\nCould there be something I need to see in a deeper, more fundamental wa y -- some paradigm within \\nmyself that affects the way I see my  time, my life, and my own nature? \\nMy marriage has gone flat. We don't fight or anything; we just don't lo ve each other anymore. \\nWe've gone to counseling; we've tried a number of th ings, but we just can't seem to rekindle the feeling \\nwe used to have. \\nThe personality ethic tells me there must be so me new book or some semi nar where people get all \\ntheir feelings out that would help my wife understand me better. Or maybe that it's useless, and only \\na new relationship will provide the love I need. \\nBut is it possible that my spouse isn't the real problem? Could I be empowering my spouse's \\nweaknesses and making my life a function of the way I'm treated? \\nDo I have some basic paradigm about my spouse, about marriage, abou t what love really is, that is \\nfeeding the problem? \\nCan you see how fundamentally the paradigms of  the personality ethic affect the very way we see \\nour problems as well as the way we attempt to solve them? \\nWhether people see it or not, many are beco ming disillusioned with th e empty promises of the \\npersonality ethic.

They want more than aspirin and band-aids.  They want \\nto solve the chronic underlying problems and focus on the principles that bring long-term results. \\nA New Level of Thinking \\n   Albert Einstein observed, \"The significant  prob lems we face cannot be solved at the same level of \\nthinking we were at when we created them. \\nAs we look around us and within us and reco gnize the problems created as we live and interact \\nwithin the personality ethic, we be gin to realize that these are deep, fundamental problems that cannot \\nbe solved on the superficial level on which they were created. \\nWe need a new level, a deeper level of thinking  -- a paradigm based on the principles that accurately \\ndescribe the territory of effective human being an d interacting -- to solve these deep concerns. \\nThis new level of thinking is what Seven Habi ts of Highly Effective People is about.  It\\'s a \\nprinciple-centered, character-based, \"Inside-Out\" appr oach to personal and inte rpersonal effectiveness. \\n\"Inside-Out\" means to start first with self; even  more fundamentally, to st art with the most inside \\npart of self -- with your paradigms, your character, and your motives. \\nIt says if you want to have a happy marriage, be the kind of person who generates positive energy \\nand sidesteps negative energy rather than empowerin g it.  If you want to have a more pleasant, \\ncooperative teenager, be a more understanding, empa thic, consistent, loving parent. If you want to \\nh a v e  m o r e  f r e e d o m ,  m o r e  l a t i t u d e  i n  y o u r  j o b , be a more responsible, a more helpful, a more \\ncontributing employee. If you want to be truste d, be trustworthy.  If you want the secondary \\ngreatness of recognized talent, focus first on primary greatness of character. \\nThe Inside-Out approach says that Private Vict ories TM precede Public Victories TM, that making \\nand keeping promises to ourselves precedes making and keeping promises to others. It says it is futile \\nto put personality ahead of character, to try to im prove relationships with others before improving \\nourselves. \\nInside-Out is a process -- a continuing process of renewal based on the natural laws that govern \\nhuman growth and progress. It\\'s an upward spiral of growth that leads to progressively higher forms \\nof responsible independence an d effective interdependence. \\nI have had the opportunity to work with many people -- wonderful people, talented people, people \\nwho deeply want to achieve happiness and success, people who are searching, people who are hurting. \\nI\\'ve worked with business executives, college studen ts, church and civic groups, families and marriage \\npartners. And in all of my experience, I have never seen lasting solutions to problems, lasting \\nhappiness and success, that came from the outside in. \\nWhat I have seen result from the outside-in paradigm is unhappy people who feel victimized and \\nimmobilized, who focus on the weaknesses of other people and the circumstances they feel are responsible for their own stagnant situation. I\\'ve seen unhappy marriages where each spouse wants \\nthe other to change, where each is confessing the ot her\\'s \"sins,\" where each is trying to shape up the \\nother. I\\'ve seen labor management disputes where people spend tremendous amounts of time and energy trying to create legislation that would force pe ople to act as though the foundation of trust were \\nreally there. \\nMembers of our family have lived in three of the \"hottest\" spots on earth -- South Africa, Israel, and \\nIreland -- and I believe the source of the continuing problems in each of these places has been the dominant social paradigm of outside-in. Each involv ed group is convinced the problem is \"out there\" \\nand if \"they\" (meaning others) would \"shape up\" or suddenly \"ship out\" of  existence, the problem \\nwould be solved.

To recognize and develop them and to use them in meeting our deepest \\nconcerns, we need to think differently, to shift our paradigms to a new, deeper, \"Inside-Out\" level. \\nAs we sincerely seek to understand and integ rate these principles into our lives, I am convinced we \\nwill discover and rediscover the truth of T. S. Eliot\\'s observation: \\nWe must not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we \\nbegan and to know the place for the first time. \\nThe Seven Habits -- An Overview \\nWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit. \\n   -- Aristotl \\nOur character, basically, is a composite of our habits . \"Sow a thought, reap an action; sow an action, \\nreap a habit; sow a habit, reap a character; sow a character, reap a destiny,\" the maxim goes. \\nHabits are powerful factors in our lives. Beca use they are consistent, often unconscious patterns, \\nthey constantly, daily, express our character and produce our effectiveness or ineffectiveness. \\nAs Horace Mann, the great educator, once said, \"Habits are like a cable. We weave a strand of it \\neveryday and soon it cannot be broken.\" I personally do not agree with the last part of his expression. \\nI know they can be broken. Habits can be learned an d unlearned. But I also know it isn\\'t a quick fix. \\nIt involves a process and a tremendous commitment. \\nThose of us who watched the lunar voyage of  Apollo 11 were transfixed as we saw the first men \\nwalk on the moon and return to earth. Superl atives such as \"fantastic\" and \"incredible\" were \\ninadequate to describe those eventful days. But to ge t there, those astronauts literally had to break out \\nof the tremendous gravity pull of the earth. More energy was spent in the firs t few minutes of lift-off, \\nin the first few miles of travel, than was used over the next several days to travel half a million miles. \\nHabits, too, have tremendous gravity pull -- more than most people realize or would admit. \\nBreaking deeply imbedded habitual tendencies such  as procrastination, impatience, criticalness, or \\nselfishness that violate basic principles of human effe ctiveness involves more than a little willpower and \\na few minor changes in our lives. \"Lift off\" takes a tremendous effort, but once we break out of the \\ngravity pull, our freedom takes on a whole new dimension. \\nLike any natural force, gravity pull can work with  us or against us. The gravity pull of some of our \\nhabits may currently be keeping us from going where we want to go. But it is also gravity pull that \\nkeeps our world together, that keep s the planets in their orbits and our universe in order. It is a \\npowerful force, and if we use it effectively, we can use the gravity pull of habit to create the \\ncohesiveness and order necessary to establish effectiveness in our lives. \\n\"Habits\" Defined \\nFor our purposes, we will define a habit as th e intersection of knowledge, skill, and desire. \\nKnowledge is the theoretical paradigm, the what to do and the why. Skill is the how to do. And desire is the motivation, the want to do. In order to make something a habit in our lives, we have to \\nhave all three. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 22}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nI may be ineffective in my interactions with my  work associates, my spouse, or my children because \\nI constantly tell them what I think, but I never really listen to them. Unless I search out correct \\nprinciples of human interaction, I ma y not even know I need to listen. \\nEven if I do know that in order to interact effe ctively with others I really need to listen to them, I \\nmay not have the skill. I may not know how to really listen deeply to another human being. \\nBut knowing I need to listen and knowing how to  listen is not enough. Unless I want to listen, \\nunless I have the desire, it won\\'t be a habit in my life. Creating a habit requires work in all three \\ndimensions. \\nThe being/seeing change is an upward proce ss -- being changing, seeing , which in turn changes \\nbeing, and so forth, as we move in  an upward spiral of growth. By working on knowledge, skill, and \\ndesire, we can break through to new levels of person al and interpersonal effectiveness as we break with \\nold paradigms that may have been a source of pseudo-security for years. \\nIt\\'s sometimes a painful process. It\\'s a change that has to be motivated by a higher purpose, by the \\nwillingness to subordinate what yo u think you want now for what you want later. But this process \\nproduces happiness, \"the object and design of our existence.\" Happiness ca n be defined, in part at least, \\nas the fruit of the desire and ability to sacrific e what we want now for what we want eventually. \\nThe Maturity Continuum TM \\nThe Seven Habits are not a set of separate or piecemeal psyche-up formulas. In harmony with the \\nnatural laws of growth, they provide an incrementa l, sequential, highly integrated approach to the \\ndevelopment of personal and interpersonal effectiven ess. They move us progressively on a Maturity \\nContinuum from dependence to interdependence. \\n   We each begin life as an in fant, totally dependent on others. We are directed, nurtured, and \\nsustained by others. Without this nurturing, we woul d only live for a few hours or a few days at the \\nmost. \\nThen gradually, over the ensuing months an d years, we become more and more independent -- \\nphysically, mentally, emotionally, and financially -- until eventually we can essentially take care of \\nourselves, becoming inner-directed and self-reliant. \\nAs we continue to grow and mature, we beco me increasingly aware that all of nature is \\ninterdependent, that there is an ec ological system that governs nature , including society. We further \\ndiscover that the higher reaches of our nature have to do with our relationships with others -- that \\nhuman life also is interdependent. \\nOur growth from infancy to adulthood is in accordance with natural law. And there are many \\ndimensions to growth. Reaching our full physical maturity, for example, does not necessarily assure \\nus of simultaneous emotional or mental maturity. On the other hand, a person\\'s physical dependence \\ndoes not mean that he or she is mentally or emotionally immature. \\nOn the maturity continuum, dependence is the paradigm of you -- you take care of me; you come \\nthrough for me; you didn\\'t come thro ugh; I blame you for the results. \\nIndependence is the paradigm of I -- I can do it ; I am responsible; I am self-reliant; I can choose. \\nInterdependence is the paradigm of we -- we can do it: we can cooperate; we can combine our \\ntalents and abilities and create something greater together. \\nDependent people need others to get what they want.  Independent people  can get what they want \\nthrough their own effort. Interdependent people comb ine their own efforts with the efforts of others to \\nachieve their greatest success. \\nIf I were physically dependent -- paralyzed or di sabled or limited in some physical way -- I would \\nneed you to help me. If I were emotionally depe ndent, my sense of worth and security would come \\nfrom your opinion of me. If you didn\\'t like me, it  could be devastating. If I were intellectually '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 23}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\ndependent, I would count on you to do my thinking for me, to think through the issues and problems of \\nmy life. \\nIf I were independent, physically, I could pretty well make it on my own. Mentally, I could think \\nmy own thoughts, I could move from one level of ab straction to another. I could think creatively and \\nanalytically and organize and express my thoughts in understandable ways. Emotionally, I would be \\nvalidated from within. I would be inner directed . My sense of worth would not be a function of \\nbeing liked or treated well. \\nIt\\'s easy to see that independence is much mo re mature than dependence. Independence is a major \\nachievement in and of itself. Bu t independence is not supreme. \\nNevertheless, the current social paradigm enthrone s independence. It is the avowed goal of many \\nindividuals and social movements. Most of the self-improvement ma terial puts independence on a \\npedestal, as though communication, team work, and cooperation were lesser values. \\nNevertheless, the current social paradigm enthrone s independence. It is the avowed goal of many \\nindividuals and social movements. Most of the self-improvement ma terial puts independence on a \\npedestal, as though communication, team work, and cooperation were lesser values. \\nBut much of our current emphasis on independence  is a reaction to dependence -- to having others \\ncontrol us, define us, use us, and manipulate us. \\nThe little understood concept of interdepende nce appears to many to smack of dependence, and \\ntherefore, we find people often fo r selfish reasons, leaving their m arriages, abandoning their children, \\nand forsaking all kinds of social responsibility -- all in the name of independence. \\n   T h e  k i n d  o f  r e a c t i o n  t h a t  r e s u l t s  i n  p e o p l e \"throwing off their shackles,\" becoming \"liberated,\" \\n\"asserting themselves,\" and \"doing their own thing\" often reveals more fundam ental dependencies that \\ncannot be run away from because they are internal rat her than external -- dependencies such as letting \\nthe weaknesses of other people ruin our emotional live s or feeling victimized by people and events out \\nof our control. \\nOf course, we may need to change our circumst ances. But the dependence problem is a personal \\nmaturity issue that has little to do with circumstan ces. Even with better circumstances, immaturity \\nand dependence often persist. \\nTrue independence of character empowers us to ac t rather than be acted upon. It frees us from our \\ndependence on circumstances and other people and is a worthy, liberating goal. But it is not the \\nultimate goal in effective living. \\nIndependent thinking alone is not suited to in terdependent reality. Independent people who do \\nnot have the maturity to think and act interdependent ly may be good individual producers, but they \\nwon\\'t be good leaders or team players. They\\'re not coming from the paradigm of interdependence \\nnecessary to succeed in marriage, family, or organizational reality. \\nLife is, by nature, highly interdependent.  To try to achieve maximum effectiveness through \\nindependence is like trying to play tennis with a golf  club -- the tool is not suited to the reality. \\nInterdependence is a far more mature, more advanc ed concept. If I am physically interdependent, I \\nam self-reliant and capable, but I also realize that  you and I working together can accomplish far more \\nthan, even at my best, I could accomplish alone. If  I am emotionally interdependent, I derive a great \\nsense of worth within myself, but I also recognize th e need for love, for giving, and for receiving love \\nfrom others. If I am intellectually interdependent, I re alize that I need the best thinking of other people \\nto join with my own. \\nAs an interdependent person, I have the oppo rtunity to share myself d eeply, meaningfully, with \\nothers, and I have access to the vast resources and potential of other human beings. \\nInterdependence is a choice only independen t people can make. Dependent people cannot choose \\nto become interdependent. They don\\'t have th e character to do it; they don\\'t own enough of \\nthemselves.

They move a person \\nfrom dependence to independence. They are the \"P rivate Victories,\" the essence of character growth. \\nPrivate Victories precede Public Victories. You can\\'t invert that process anym ore than you can harvest \\na crop before you plant it. It\\'s Inside-Out. \\nAs you become truly independent, you have the foundation for effective interdependence. You \\nhave the character base from which you can effectivel y work on the more personality-oriented \"Public \\nVictories\" of teamwork, cooperation, and communication in Habits 4, 5, and 6. \\nThat does not mean you have to be perfect in Habits 1, 2, and 3 before work ing on Habits 4, 5, and 6. \\nUnderstanding the sequence will help you manage  your growth more effectively, but I\\'m not \\nsuggesting that you put yourself in isolation for several years until you fully develop Habits 1, 2, and 3. \\nAs part of an interdependent world, you have to relate to that world every day. But the acute \\nproblems of that world can easily obscure the ch ronic character causes. Understanding how what you \\nare impacts every interdependent interaction will he lp you to focus your e fforts sequentially, in \\nharmony with the natural laws of growth. \\nHabit 7 is the habit of renewal -- a regular, balanced  renewal of the four basic dimensions of life. It \\ncircles and embodies all the other habits. It is th e habit of continuous improvement that creates the \\nupward spiral of growth that lifts you to new levels  of understanding and living each of the habits as \\nyou come around to them on a progressively higher plane. \\nThe diagram on the next page is a visual repres entation of the sequence and the interdependence of \\nthe Seven Habits, and will be used throughout this b ook as we explore both the sequential relationship \\nbetween the habits and also their synergy -- how, in relating to each other, th ey create bold new forms \\nof each other that add even more to their value. Each concept or habit will be highlighted as it is \\nintroduced. \\nEffectiveness Defined \\nThe Seven Habits are habits of effectiveness. Because they are based on principles, they bring the \\nmaximum long-term beneficial results possible.  They become the basis of a person\\'s character, \\ncreating an empowering center of correct maps from which an individual can effectively solve problems, \\nmaximize opportunities, and continually learn and integrate other principles in an upward spiral of \\ngrowth. \\nThey are also habits of effectiveness because they  are based on a paradigm of effectiveness that is in \\nharmony with a natural law, a prin ciple I call the \"P/PC Balance,\" whic h many people break themselves \\nagainst. This principle can be easily understood  by remembering Aesop\\'s fa ble of the Goose and the \\nGolden Egg TM. \\nThis fable is the story of a poor farmer who one day discovers in the nest of his pet goose a glittering \\ngolden egg. At first, he thinks it must be some ki nd of trick. But as he starts to throw the egg aside, \\nhe has second thoughts and takes it in to be appraised instead. \\nThe egg is pure gold! The farmer can\\'t belie ve his good fortune.  He becomes even more \\nincredulous the following day when th e experience is repeated. Day after day, he awakens to rush to \\nthe nest and find another golden egg. He becomes fa bulously wealthy; it all seems too good to be true. \\nBut with his increasing wealth comes greed and impatience. Unable to wait day after day for the \\ngolden eggs, the farmer decides he will kill the goose and get them all at once. But when he opens the \\ngoose, he finds it empty. There are no golden e ggs -- and now there is no way to get any more. The \\nfarmer has destroyed the goose that produced them. \\nBut as the story shows, true effectiveness is a function of two things: what is produced (the golden \\neggs) and the producing asset or capacity to produce (the goose). '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 25}, page_content=\"T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nIf you adopt a pattern of life that focuses on go lden eggs and neglects the goose, you will soon be \\nwithout the asset that produces golden eggs. On th e other hand, if you only take care of the goose \\nwith no aim toward the golden eggs, you soon won' t have the wherewithal to feed yourself or the \\ngoose. \\nEffectiveness lies in the balance -- what I call the P/PC Balance TM. P stands for production of \\ndesired results, the golden eggs. PC stands for produc tion capability, the ability or asset that produces \\nthe golden eggs. \\nThree Kinds of Assets \\nBasically, there are three kinds of assets: physical , financial, and human. Let's look at each one in \\nturn. \\nA few years ago, I purchased a physical asset -- a power lawn mower. I used it over and over again \\nwithout doing anything to maintain it. The mower worked well for two seasons, but then it began to \\nbreak down. When I tried to revive it with serv ice and sharpening, I discovered the engine had lost \\nover half its original power capacity. It was essentially worthless. \\nHad I invested in PC -- in preserving and mainta ining the asset -- I would still be enjoying its P -- the \\nmowed lawn. As it was, I had to spend far more  time and money replacing the mower than I ever \\nwould have spent, had I maintained it.  It simply wasn't effective. \\nIn our quest for short-term re turns, or results, we often ruin a prized physical asset -- a car, a \\ncomputer, a washer or dryer, even our body or ou r environment. Keeping P and PC in balance makes \\na tremendous difference in the e ffective use of physical assets. \\n   It also powerfully impacts the effective use of  financial assets.  How often do people confuse \\nprincipal with interest? Have you ever invaded princi pal to increase your standard of living, to get \\nmore golden eggs? The decreasing principal has decr easing power to produce interest or income. And \\nthe dwindling capital becomes smaller and smaller un til it no longer supplies even our basic needs. \\nOur most important financial asset is our own ca pacity to earn. If we don't continually invest in \\nimproving our own PC, we severely limit our options.  We're locked  into our present situation, \\nrunning scared of our corporation or  our boss's opinion of us, economic ally dependent and defensive. \\nAgain, it simply isn't effective. \\nIn the human area, the P/PC Balance is equally  fundamental, but even more important, because \\npeople control physical and financial assets. \\nWhen two people in a marriage are more concerned about getting the golden eggs, the benefits, than \\nthey are in preserving the relationship that make s them possible, they often become insensitive and \\ninconsiderate, neglecting the little kindnesses and cour tesies so important to a deep relationship. They \\nbegin to use control levers to manipulate each other,  to focus on their own n eeds, to justify their own \\nposition and look for evidence to show the wrongness of the other pe rson. The love, the richness, the \\nsoftness, and spontaneity begin to deteriorate. The goose gets sicker day by day. \\nAnd what about a parent's relationship with  a child? When children are little, they are very \\ndependent, very vulnerable. It becomes so ea sy to neglect the PC work -- the training, the \\ncommunicating, the relating, the listening. It's easy to take advantage, to manipulate, to get what you \\nwant the way you want it -- right now! You're bigge r, you're smarter, and you're right! So why not just \\ntell them what to do? If necessary, yell at th em, intimidate them, insist on your way. \\nOr you can indulge them. You can go for the go lden egg of popularity, of pleasing them, giving \\nthem their way all the time. Then they grow up without a personal commitment to being disciplined \\nor responsible. \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 26}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nEither way -- authoritarian or permissive -- you have the golden egg mentality. You want to have \\nyour way or you want to be liked.  But what happens, meantime, to the goose? What sense of \\nresponsibility, of self-discipline, of confidence in the ability to make good choices or achieve important \\ngoals is a child going to have a few years down th e road? And what about your relationship? When he \\nreaches those critical teenage years, the identity crises , will he know from his experience with you that \\nyou will listen without judging, that you really, deeply care about him as a person, that you can be trusted, no matter what? Will the relationship be st rong enough for you to reach him, to communicate \\nwith him, to influence him? \\nSuppose you want your daughter to have a clean room -- that\\'s P, production, the golden egg. And \\nsuppose you want her to clean it -- that\\'s PC, Produc tion Capability. Your daughter is the goose, the \\nasset, that produces the golden egg. \\nIf you have P and PC in balance, she cleans the room cheerfully, without being reminded, because \\nshe is committed and has the discipline to stay with the commitment. She is a valuable asset, a goose \\nthat can produce golden eggs. \\nBut if your paradigm is focused on Production, on getting the room clean, you might find yourself \\nnagging her to do it. You might even escalate your efforts to threatening or yelling, and in your desire \\nto get the golden egg, you undermine the health and welfare of the goose. \\nLet me share with you an interesting PC expe rience I had with one of my daughters. We were \\nplanning a private date, which is something I enjoy re gularly with each of my children. We find that \\nthe anticipation of the date is as satisfying as the realization. \\nSo I approached my daughter and said, \"Honey, tonight\\'s your night. What do you want to do?\" \\n\"Oh, Dad, that\\'s okay,\" she replied \\n\"No, really,\" I said, \"What would you like to do?\" \\n\"Well,\" she finally said, \"what I want  to do, you don\\'t really want to do.\" \\n\"Really, honey,\" I said earnestly, \"I want to do it. No matter what, it\\'s your choice.\" \\n\"I want to go see Star Wars,\" she replied. \"B ut I know you don\\'t like Star Wars. You slept through \\nit before. You don\\'t like these fa ntasy movies.  That\\'s okay, Dad.\" \\n\"No, honey, if that\\'s what you\\'d like to do, I\\'d like to do it.\" \\n\"Dad, don\\'t worry about it. We don\\'t always have  to have this date.\" She paused and then added, \\n\"But you know why you don\\'t like Star Wars? It\\'s because you don\\'t understand the philosophy and \\ntraining of a Jedi Knight.\" \\n   \" W h a t ? \" \\n\"You know the things you teach,  Dad? Those are the same things that  go into the training of a Jedi \\nKnight.\" \\n\"Really? Let\\'s go to Star Wars!\" \\nAnd we did. She sat next me and gave me th e paradigm. I became her student, her learner. It \\nwas totally fascinating. I could begin to see out of  a new paradigm the whole way a Jedi Knight\\'s basic \\nphilosophy in training is manifest ed in different circumstances. \\nThat experience was not a planned P experience; it was the serendipitous fruit of a PC investment. \\nIt was bonding and very satisfying. But we enjoyed golden eggs, too, as the goose -- the quality of the \\nrelationship -- was significantly fed. \\nOrganizational PC \\nOne of the immensely valuable aspects of any correct  principle is that it is valid and applicable in a \\nwide variety of circumstances. Throughout this book, I would like to share with you some of the ways \\nin which these principles apply to organizations, including families, as well as to individuals. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 27}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nWhen people fail to respect the P/PC Balance in their use of physical assets in organizations, they \\ndecrease organizational effectiveness and often leave others with dying geese. \\nFor example, a person in charge of a physical a sset, such as a machine, may be eager to make a good \\nimpression on his superiors. Perhaps the compan y is in a rapid growth stage and promotions are \\ncoming fast. So he produces at optimum levels  -- no downtime, no maintenance.  He runs the \\nmachine day and night.  The production is phen omenal, costs are down, and profits skyrocket. \\nWithin a short time, he\\'s promoted. Golden eggs. \\nBut suppose you are his successor on the job. You inherit a very sick goose, a machine that, by this \\ntime, is rusted and starts to break down. You have  to invest heavily in downtime and maintenance. \\nCosts skyrocket; profits nose-dive. And who gets blamed for the loss of golden eggs? You do. Your \\npredecessor liquidated the asset, but the accounting system only reported unit  production, costs, and \\nprofit. \\nThe P/PC Balance is particularly important as it applies to the human assets  of an organization -- the \\ncustomers and the employees. \\nI know of a restaurant that served a fantasti c clam chowder and was pack ed with customers every \\nday at lunchtime. Then the business was sold, and the new owner focused on golden eggs -- he \\ndecided to water down the chowder. For about a month, with costs down and revenues constant, \\nprofits zoomed. But little by little, the customers began to disappear. Trust was gone, and business \\ndwindled to almost nothing. The new owner tried desperately to reclaim it, but he had neglected the customers, violated their trust, and lost the asset of customer loyalty. There was no more goose to \\nproduce the golden egg. \\nThere are organizations that talk a lot about th e customer and then completely neglect the people \\nthat deal with the customer -- the employees. Th e PC principle is to always treat your employees \\nexactly as you want them to treat your best customers. \\nYou can buy a person\\'s hand, but you can\\'t buy his heart. His heart is where his enthusiasm, his \\nloyalty is. You can buy his back, but you can\\'t buy his brain. That\\'s where his creativity is, his \\ningenuity, his resourcefulness. \\nPC work is treating employees as volunteers just as you treat customers as volunteers, because that\\'s \\nwhat they are. They volunteer the best part -- their hearts and minds. \\nI was in a group once where someone asked, \"How do you shape up  lazy and incompetent \\nemployees?\" One man responded, \"Drop hand grenades !\" Several others cheered that kind of macho \\nmanagement talk, that \"shape up or ship out\" supervision approach. \\nBut another person in the group asked, \"Who picks up the pieces?\" \\n   \"No pieces.\" \\n\"Well, why don\\'t you do that to your customers?\" the other man replied. \"Just say, \\'Listen, if you\\'re \\nnot interested in buying, you can just ship out of this place.\\'\" \\nHe said, \"You can\\'t do that to customers.\" \\n\"Well, how come you can do it to employees?\" \\n\"Because they\\'re in your employ.\" \\n   \"I see.  Are your employees devoted to you? Do they work hard? How\\'s the turnover?\" \\n\"Are you kidding? You can\\'t find good people these days.  There\\'s too mu ch turnover, absenteeism, \\nmoonlighting. People just don\\'t care anymore.\" \\nThat focus on golden eggs -- that attitude, that paradigm -- is totally inadequate to tap into the \\npowerful energies of the mind and heart of another person. A short-term bottom line is important, but \\nit isn\\'t all-important.\\n   Effectiveness lies in the balance.  Excessive focu s on P results in ruined health, worn-out machines, \\ndepleted bank accounts, and broken relationships.

Or a person endlessl y going to school, never producing, living on other people\\'s golden \\neggs -- the eternal student syndrome. \\nTo maintain the P/PC Balance, the balance bet ween the golden egg (Product ion) and the health and \\nwelfare of the goose (Production Capability) is often a difficult judgment call. But I suggest it is the \\nvery essence of effectiveness. It balances short te rm with long term. It balances going for the grade \\nand paying the price to get an education. It balanc es the desire to have a room clean and the building \\nof a relationship in which the child is internally committed to do it -- cheerfully, willingly, without \\nexternal supervision. \\nIt\\'s a principle you can see validated in your own life when you burn the cand le at both ends to get \\nmore golden eggs and wind up sick or exhausted, un able to produce any at all; or when you get a good \\nnight\\'s sleep and wake up ready to produce throughout the day. \\nYou can see it when you press to get your own way with someone and somehow feel an emptiness \\nin the relationship; or when you really take time to invest in a relationship and you find the desire and \\nability to work together, to communicate, takes a quantum leap. \\nThe P/PC Balance is the very essence of effectivene ss. It\\'s validated in every arena of life. We can \\nwork with it or against it, but it\\'s there. It\\'s  a lighthouse.  It\\'s the definition and paradigm of \\neffectiveness upon which the Seven Habits in this book are based. \\nHow to Use This Book \\nBefore we begin work on the Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, I would like to suggest two \\nParadigm Shifts that will greatly increase the value you will receive from this material. \\nFirst, I would recommend that yo u not \"see\" this material as a book, in the sense that it is something \\nto read once and put on a shelf. \\nYou may choose to read it completely through on ce for a sense of the whole. But the material is \\ndesigned to be a companion in the continual process of change and growth.  It is organized \\nincrementally and with suggestions for application at the end of each habit so that you can study and \\nfocus on any particular habit as you are ready. \\nAs you progress to deeper levels of understa nding and implementation, you can go back time and \\nagain to the principles contained in each habit and work to expand your knowledge, skill, and desire. \\nSecond, I would suggest that you shift your p aradigm of your own involvement in this material \\nfrom the role of learner to that of teacher. Take an Inside-Out approach, and read with the purpose in \\nmind of sharing or discussing what you learn with  someone else within 48 hours after you learn it. \\nIf you had known, for example, that you wo uld be teaching the material on the P/PC Balance \\nprinciple to someone else within 48 hours, would it have made a difference in your reading experience? \\nTry it now as you read the final section in this chap ter. Read as though you are going to teach it to \\nyour spouse, your child, a business associate, or a fr iend today or tomorrow, while it is still fresh, and \\nnotice the difference in your mental and emotional process. \\nI guarantee that if you approach the material in ea ch of the following chapters in this way, you will \\nnot only better remember what yo u read, but your perspective will be expanded, your understanding \\ndeepened, and your motivation to  apply the material increased. \\nIn addition, as you openly, ho nestly share what you\\'re learning wi th others, you may be surprised to \\nfind that negative labels or perceptions others may have of you tend to disappear. Those you teach \\nwill see you as a changing, growing person, and will be more inclined to be helpful and supportive as \\nyou work, perhaps together, to integrate the Seven Habits into your lives. \\nWhat You Can Expect '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 29}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nIn the last analysis, as Marilyn Ferguson observed, \"No one can persuade another to change. Each \\nof us guards a gate of change that can only be op ened from the inside. We cannot open the gate of \\nanother, either by argument or by emotional appeal. \\nIf you decide to open your \"gate of change\" to really understand and live the principles embodied in \\nthe Seven Habits, I feel comfortable in assuring you several positive things will happen. \\nFirst, your growth with be evolutionary, but the net effect will be revolutionary. Would you not \\nagree that the P/PC Balance principle alone, if fully lived, would transform most individuals and \\norganizations? \\nThe net effect of opening the \"gate of change\" to the first three habits -- the habits of Private Victory \\n-- will be significantly increased self-confidence. You will come to know your self in a deeper, more \\nmeaningful way -- your nature, your deepest values  and your unique contribution capacity. As you \\nlive your values, your sense of identity, integrity,  control, and inner-direct edness will infuse you with \\nboth exhilaration and peace. You will define yourself  from within, rather than by people\\'s opinions or \\nby comparisons to others. \"Wrong\" and \"right\" will have little to do with being found out. \\nIronically, you\\'ll find that as you care less abou t what others think of you; you will care more about \\nwhat others think of themselves and their worlds, including their re lationship with you. You\\'ll no \\nlonger build your emotional life on other people\\'s we aknesses. In addition, you\\'ll find it easier and \\nmore desirable to change because there is something -- so me core deep within -- that is essentially \\nchangeless. \\nAs you open yourself to the next three habits -- the habits of Public Victory -- you will discover and \\nunleash both the desire and the resources to heal  and rebuild important relationships that have \\ndeteriorated, or even broken. Good relationships will improve -- become deeper, more solid, more \\ncreative, and more adventuresome. \\nThe seventh habit, if deeply internalized, will renew the first six and will make you truly \\nindependent and capable of effective interdependenc e. Through it, you can charge your own batteries. \\nWhatever your present situation, I assure you that you are not your habits. You can replace old \\npatterns of self-defeating behavior with new patte rns, new habits of effectiveness, happiness, and \\ntrust-based relationships. \\nWith genuine caring, I encourage you to open the gate of change and growth as you study these \\nhabits. Be patient with yourself.  Self-growth is  tender; it\\'s holy ground.  There\\'s no greater \\ninvestment. \\nIt\\'s obviously not a quick fix. But I assure you, you will feel benefits and see immediate payoffs \\nthat will be encouraging. In the words of Thomas  Paine, \"That which we obta in too easily, we esteem \\ntoo lightly. It is dearness only which gives everyth ing its value. Heaven knows how to put a proper \\nprice on its goods.\" '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 30}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nPart Two \\nPrivate Victory \\nHabit 1: Be Proactive --Principles of Personal Visio \\nI know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable ability of man to elevate his life by \\nconscious endeavor. \\n   -- Henry David Thorea \\nAs you read this book, try to stand apart from yourself. Try to project your consciousness upward \\ninto a corner of the room and see yourself, in your  mind\\'s eye, reading. Can you look at yourself \\nalmost as though yo u were someone else? \\nNow try something else. Think about the mood  you are now in. Can you identify it? What are \\nyou feeling? How would you describe your present mental state \\nNow think for a minute about how your mind is wo rking. Is it quick and alert? Do you sense that \\nyou are torn between doing this me ntal exercise and evaluating th e point to be made out of it? \\nYour ability to do what you just did is unique ly human. Animals do not possess this ability. We \\ncall it \"self-awareness\" or the ability to think about yo ur very thought process. This is the reason why \\nman has dominion over all things in the world and why he can make significant advances from \\ngeneration to generation. \\nThis is why we can evaluate and learn from othe rs\\' experiences as well as our own. This is also \\nwhy we can make and break our habits. \\nWe are not our feelings. We are not our moods. We are not even our thoughts. The very fact \\nthat we can think about these things separates us from them and from the animal world. \\nSelf-awareness enables us to stand apart and examin e even the way we \"see\" ourselves -- our paradigm, \\nthe most fundamental paradigm of effectiveness. It affects not only our attitudes and behaviors, but also how we see other people. It becomes our map of the basic nature of mankind. \\nIn fact, until we take how we see ourselves (and  how we see others) into account, we will be unable \\nto understand how others see and feel about themse lves and their world. Unaware, we will be unable \\nto understand how others see and feel about themselves and their world. Unaware, we will project our intentions on their behavior and call ourselves objective. \\nThis significantly limits our personal potential and our ability to relate to others as well. But \\nbecause of the unique human capacity of self-awareness, we can examine our paradigms to determine \\nwhether they are reality- or principle-based or if they are a function of conditioning and conditions. \\nThe Social Mirror \\nIf the only vision we have of ourselves come s from the social mirror -- from the current social \\nparadigm and from the opinions, perceptions, and paradigms of the people around us -- our view of ourselves is like the reflection in th e crazy mirror room at the carnival. \\n   \"You\\'re never on time.\" \\n\"Why can\\'t you ever keep things in order?\" \\n\"You must be an artist!\" \\n\"You eat like a horse!\" \\n   \"I can\\'t believe you won!\" '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 31}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\n\"This is so simple. Why can\\'t you understand?\" \\nThese visions are disjointed and out of proportion . They are often more proj ections than reflections, \\nprojecting the concerns and cha racter weaknesses of people giving the input rather than accurately \\nreflecting what we are. \\nThe reflection of the current social paradigm tells us we are largely determined by conditioning and \\nconditions. While we have acknowledged the tremen dous power of conditioning in our lives, to say \\nthat we are determined by it, that we have no control over that influence, creates quite a different map. \\nThere are actually three social maps -- three th eories of determinism widely accepted, independently \\nor in combination, to explain the nature of man. Genetic determinism basically says your \\ngrandparents did it to you.  That\\'s why you ha ve such a temper.  Your grandparents had short \\ntempers and it\\'s in your DNA. It just goes throug h the generations and you inherited it. In addition, \\nyou\\'re Irish, and that\\'s the nature of Irish people. \\nPsychic determinism basically says your parents did it to you. Your upbringing, your childhood \\nexperience essentially laid out your personal tend encies and your character structure. That\\'s why \\nyou\\'re afraid to be in front of a group. It\\'s th e way your parents brought you up. You feel terribly \\nguilty if you make a mistake because you \"remember\"  deep inside the emotional scripting when you \\nwere very vulnerable and tender and dependent. You \"remember\" the emotional punishment, the \\nrejection, the comparison with somebody else when you didn\\'t perform as well as expected. \\nEnvironmental determinism basically says your boss  is doing to you -- or your spouse, or that bratty \\nteenager, or your economic situation, or national policies.  Someone or some thing in your environment \\nis responsible for your situation. \\nEach of these maps is based on the stimulus/r esponse theory we most often think of in connection \\nwith Pavlov\\'s experiments with dogs. The basic idea is that we are conditioned to respond in a \\nparticular way to a particular stimulus. \\nHow accurately and functionally do these determ inistic maps describe the territory? How clearly do \\nthese mirrors reflect the true nature of man? Do they become self-fulfilling prophecies? Are they based \\non principles we can validate within ourselves? \\nBetween Stimulus and Response \\nIn answer to those questions, let me share  with you the catalytic story of Viktor Frankl. \\nFrankl was a determinist raised in the traditio n of Freudian psychology,  which postulates that \\nwhatever happens to you as a child shapes your character and personality and basically governs your \\nwhole life. The limits and parameters of your life are  set, and, basically, you can\\'t do much about it. \\nFrankl was also a psychiatrist and a Jew. He was imprisoned in the deat h camps of Nazi Germany, \\nwhere he experienced things that were so repugnant to our sense of decency that we shudder to even \\nrepeat them. \\nHis parents, his brother, and his wife died in th e camps or were sent to the gas ovens. Except for \\nhis sister, his entire family perished. Frankl hi mself suffered torture and innumerable indignities, \\nnever knowing from one moment to the next if his path would lead to the ovens or if he would be \\namong the \"saved\" who would remove the bodies or shovel out the ashes of those so fated. \\nOne day, naked and alone in a small room, he be gan to become aware of what he later called \"the \\nlast of the human freedoms\" -- the freedom his Nazi  captors could not take away. They could control \\nhis entire environment, they could do what they wanted to his body, but Viktor Frankl himself was a \\nself-aware being who could look as an observer at hi s very involvement. His ba sic identity was intact. \\nHe could decide within himself how all of this was going to affect him. Between what happened to \\nhim, or the stimulus, and his response to it, wa s his freedom or power to choose that response. \\nIn the midst of his experiences, Frankl would project himself into different circumstances, such as '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 32}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nlecturing to his students after his release from th e death camps. He would describe himself in the \\nclassroom, in his mind\\'s eye, and give his students the lessons he was learning during his very torture. \\nThrough a series of such disciplines -- mental , emotional, and moral, principally using memory and \\nimagination -- he exercised his small, embryonic freed om until it grew larger and larger, until he had \\nmore freedom than his Nazi captors. They had mo re liberty, more options to choose from in their \\nenvironment; but he had more freedom, more internal power to exercise his options. He became an \\ninspiration to those around him, even to some of th e guards. He helped others find meaning in their \\nsuffering and dignity in their prison existence. \\nIn the midst of the most de grading circumstances imaginable, F rankl used the human endowment of \\nself-awareness to discover a fundamental principle about the nature of man: Between stimulus and \\nresponse, man has the freedom to choose. \\nWithin the freedom to choose are those endowments  that make us uniquely human. In addition to \\nself-awareness, we have imagination -- the ability to create in our minds beyond our present reality. \\nWe have conscience -- a deep inner awareness of ri ght and wrong, of the principles that govern our \\nbehavior, and a sense of the degree to which our thoughts and actions are in harmony with them.  And \\nwe have independent will -- the ability to act based on our self-awareness, free of all other influences. \\nEven the most intelligent animals have none of  these endowments. To use a computer metaphor, \\nthey are programmed by instin ct and/or training. They can be trai ned to be responsible, but they can\\'t \\ntake responsibility for that training; in other word s, they can\\'t direct it.  They can\\'t change the \\nprogramming. They\\'re not even aware of it. \\nBut because of our unique human endowments , we can write new programs for ourselves totally \\napart from our instincts and training. This is why an animal\\'s capacity is relatively limited and man\\'s \\nis unlimited. But if we live like animals, out of ou r own instincts and conditioning and conditions, out \\nof our collective memory, we too will be limited. \\n   The deterministic paradigm comes primarily from  the study of animals -- rats, monkeys, pigeons, \\ndogs -- and neurotic and psychotic people. While th is may meet certain criteria of some researchers \\nbecause it seems measurable and predictable, the hi story of mankind and our own self-awareness tell us \\nthat this map doesn\\'t describe the territory at all! \\nOur unique human endowments lift us above the animal world. The extent to which we exercise \\nand develop these endowments empowers us to fulfill our uniquely human potential.  Between \\nstimulus and response is our greate st power -- the freedom to choose. \\n\"Proactivity\" Defined \\nIn discovering the basic principle of the nature of man, Frankl described an accurate self-map from \\nwhich he began to develop the first and most basic habit of a highly e ffective person in any \\nenvironment, the habit of Proactivity. \\nWhile the word proactivity is now fairly common in management literature, it is a word you won\\'t \\nfind in most dictionaries. It means more than merely  taking initiative. It means that as human beings, \\nwe are responsible for our own lives. Our behavior is  a function of our decisions, not our conditions. \\nWe can subordinate feelings to values. We have th e initiative and the respon sibility to make things \\nhappen. \\nLook at the word responsibility -- \"response-ab ility\" -- the ability to choose your response. Highly \\nproactive people recognize that responsibility.  They do not blame circum stances, conditions, or \\nconditioning for their behavior. Their behavior is  a product of their own conscious choice, based on \\nvalues, rather than a product of th eir conditions, based on feeling. \\nBecause we are, by nature, proactive, if our lives are a function of conditioning and conditions, it is \\nbecause we have, by conscious decision or by defaul t, chosen to empower those things to control us. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 33}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nIn making such a choice, we become reactive. Re active people are often affected by their physical \\nenvironment. If the weather is good, they feel good . If it isn\\'t, it affects their attitude and their \\nperformance. Proactive people can carry their own weather with them. Whether it rains or shines \\nmakes no difference to them. They are value driven ; and if their value is to produce good quality \\nwork, it isn\\'t a function of whether the weather is conducive to it or not. \\nReactive people are also affected by their soci al environment, by the \"social weather.\" When people \\ntreat them well, they feel well; when people don\\'t,  they become defensive or protective. Reactive \\npeople build their emotional lives around the behavi or of others, empowering the weaknesses of other \\npeople to control them. \\nThe ability to subordinate an impulse to a value is the essence of the proa ctive person.  Reactive \\npeople are driven by feelings, by circumstances, by conditions, by th eir environment. Proactive people \\nare driven by values -- carefully thought about, selected and internalized values. \\nProactive people are still influenced by external stimuli, whether physical, social, or psychological. \\nBut their response to the stimuli, conscious or unconscious, is a value-based choice or response. \\nAs Eleanor Roosevelt observed, \"No one can hu rt you without your consent.\" In the words of \\nGandhi, \"They cannot take away our self respect if  we do not give it to them.\" It is our willing \\npermission, our consent to what happe ns to us, that hurts us far more than what happens to us in the \\nfirst place. \\n   I admit this is very hard to accept emotionally, especially if we have had years and years of \\nexplaining our misery in the name of circumstance or someone else\\'s behavior. But until a person can \\nsay deeply and honestly, \"I am what I am today because of the choice s I made yesterday,\" that person \\ncannot say, \"I choose otherwise.\" \\nOnce in Sacramento when I was speaking on th e subject of Proactivity, a woman in the audience \\nstood up in the middle of my presentation and start ed talking excitedly. It was a large audience, and \\nas a number of people turned to look at her, she suddenly became aware of what she was doing, grew \\nembarrassed and sat back down. But she seemed to find it difficult to restrain herself and started \\ntalking to the people around her. She seemed so happy. \\nI could hardly wait for a break to find ou t what had happened.  When it finally came, I \\nimmediately went to her and asked if she would be willing to share her experience. \\n\"You just can\\'t imagine what\\'s happened to me!\" she exclaimed. \"I\\'m a full-time nurse to the most \\nmiserable, ungrateful man you can possibly imagine. Nothing I do is good enough for him. He never \\nexpresses appreciation; he hardly even acknowledges me.  He constantly harp s at me and finds fault \\nwith everything I do. This man has made my life mi serable and I often take my  frustration out on my \\nfamily. The other nurses feel the same way. We almost pray for his demise. \\n\"And for you to have the gall to stand up there and suggest that nothing can hurt me, that no one \\ncan hurt me without my consent, and that I have chosen my own emotional life of being miserable -- \\nwell, there was just no way I could buy into that. \\n\"But I kept thinking about it. I really went insi de myself and began to ask, \\'Do I have the power to \\nchoose my response?\" \\n\"When I finally realized that I do have that power, when I swallowed that bitter pill and realized \\nthat I had chosen to be miserable, I also realized that I could choose not to be miserable. \\n\"At that moment I stood up. I felt as though I was being let out of San Quentin. I wanted to yell \\nto the whole world, \\'I am free! I am let out of pr ison! No longer am I going to be controlled by the \\ntreatment of some person.\\'\" \\nIt\\'s not what happens to us, but our response to what happens to us that hu rts us. Of course, things \\ncan hurt us physically or economically and can cause sorrow. But our character, our basic identity, \\ndoes not have to be hurt at all. In fact, our most  difficult experiences become the crucibles that forge \\nour character and develop the internal powers, the fr eedom to handle difficult circumstances in the '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 34}, page_content=\"T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nfuture and to inspire others to do so as well. \\nFrankl is one of many who have been able  to develop the personal freedom in difficult \\ncircumstances to lift and inspire others. The autobiographical accounts of Vietnam prisoners of war \\nprovide additional persuasive testimony of the tran sforming power of such personal freedom and the \\neffect of the responsible use of that freedom on the prison culture and on the prisoners, both then and \\nnow. \\nWe have all known individuals in very difficult  circumstances, perhaps wi th a terminal illness or a \\nsevere physical handicap, who maintain magnificent emotional strength. How inspired we are by their integrity! Nothing has a greater, longer la sting impression upon an other person than the \\nawareness that someone has transcended suffering, has transcended circumstance, and is embodying \\nand expressing a value that inspires and ennobles and lifts life. \\nOne of the most inspiring times Sandra and I have  ever had took place over a four-year period with \\na dear friend of ours named Carol,  who had a wasting cancer disease. She had been one of Sandra's \\nbridesmaids, and they had been best friends for over 25 years. \\nWhen Carol was in the very la st stages of the disease, Sandra spent time at her bedside helping her \\nwrite her personal history. She returned from those protracted and difficult sessions almost transfixed by admiration for her friend's courage and her desi re to write special messages to be given to her \\nchildren at different stages in their lives. \\nCarol would take as little pain-killing medication as possible so that she had full access to her mental \\nand emotional faculties. Then she would whisper into a tape recorder or to Sandra directly as she took \\nnotes. Carol was so proactive, so brave, and so concerned about others that she became an enormous \\nsource of inspiration to many people around her. \\nI'll never forget the experience of looking deep ly into Carol's eyes the day before she passed away \\nand sensing out of that deep hollo wed agony a person of tremendous intrinsic worth. I could see in \\nher eyes a life of character, contribution, and serv ice as well as love, concern, and appreciation. \\nMany times over the years, I have asked groups of people how many have ever experienced being in \\nthe presence of a dying indivi dual who had a magnificent attitude and communicated love and \\ncompassion and served in unmatchable ways to th e very end.  Usually, about one-fourth of the \\naudience respond in the affirmative. I then ask ho w many of them will never forget these individuals \\n-- how many were transformed, at least temporarily , by the inspiration of such courage, and were \\ndeeply moved and motivated to more noble acts of service and compassion. The same people respond again, almost inevitably. \\nViktor Frankl suggests that there are three cent ral values in life -- the experiential, or that which \\nhappens to us; the creative, or that which we bring into  existence; and the attitudinal, or our response in \\ndifficult circumstances such as terminal illness. \\nMy own experience with peop le confirms the point Frankl make s -- that the highest of the three \\nvalues is attitudinal, in the paradig m of reframing sense. In other words, what matters most is how we \\nrespond to what we experience in life. \\nDifficult circumstances often create Paradigm Sh ifts, whole new frames of reference by which people \\nsee the world and themselves and others in it, and what  life is asking of them. Their larger perspective \\nreflects the attitudinal values that lift and inspire us all. \\nTaking the Initiative \\nOur basic nature is to act, and not be acted up on. As well as enabling us to choose our response to \\nparticular circumstances, this empo wers us to create circumstances \\nTaking initiative does not mean being pushy, ob noxious, or aggressive. It does mean recognizing \\nour responsibility to make things happen. \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 35}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nOver the years, I have frequently counseled people  who wanted better jobs to show more initiative -- \\nto take interest and aptitude tests, to study the industry, even the specific problems the organizations \\nthey are interested in are facing, and then to develop an effective presentation showing how their \\nabilities can help solve the organization\\'s problem. It\\'s called \"solution selling,\" and is a key paradigm in business success. \\nThe response is usually agreement -- most pe ople can see how powerfully such an approach would \\naffect their opportunities for employment or adva ncement.  But many of them fail to take the \\nnecessary steps, the initiative, to make it happen. \\n\"I don\\'t know where to go to ta ke the interest and aptitude test.\" \\n\"How do I study industry and organizat ional problems? No one wants to help me.\" \\nMany people wait for something to happen or so meone to take care of them. But people who end \\nup with the good jobs are the proactive ones who are solutions to problems, not problems themselves, \\nwho seize the initiative to do whatever is necessary , consistent with correct principles, to get the job \\ndone. \\nWhenever someone in our family, even one of th e younger children, takes an irresponsible position \\nand waits for someone else to make things happen or provide a solution, we tell them, \"Use your R and I!\" (resourcefulness and initiative).  In fact, often before we can say it, they answer their own \\ncomplaints, \"I know -- use my R and I!\" \\nHolding people to the responsible course is not demeaning; it is affirming. Proactivity is part of \\nhuman nature, and although the proactive muscles may be dormant, they are there. By respecting the \\nproactive nature of other people, we provide them wi th at least one clear, undistorted reflection from \\nthe social mirror. \\nOf course, the maturity level of the individual ha s to be taken into account. We can\\'t expect high \\ncreative cooperation from those who are deep into em otional dependence. But we can, at least, affirm \\ntheir basic nature and create an atmosphere where pe ople can seize opportunities and solve problems in \\nan increasingly self-reliant way. \\nAct or be Acted Upon \\nThe difference between people who exercise initia tive and those who don\\'t is  literally the difference \\nbetween night and day. I\\'m not talking about a 25 to  50 percent difference in effectiveness; I\\'m talking \\nabout a 5000-plus percent difference, particularly if they are smart, aware, and sensitive to others. \\nIt takes initiative to create the P/PC Balance of effectiveness in your life. It takes initiative to \\ndevelop the Seven Habits. As you study the other six habits, you will see that each depends on the \\ndevelopment of your proactive muscles. Each puts the responsibility on you to act. If you wait to be \\nacted upon, you will be acted upon. And growth an d opportunity consequences attend either road. \\nAt one time I worked with a group of people  in the home improvement industry, representatives \\nfrom 20 different organizations who met quarterly  to share their numbers and problems in an \\nuninhibited way. \\nThis was during a time of heavy recession, and the negative impact on this particular industry was \\neven heavier than on the economy in general. These people were fairly discouraged as we began. \\nThe first day, our discussion question was \"Wha t\\'s happening to us? What\\'s the stimulus?\" Many \\nthings were happening.  The environmental pr essures were powerful.  There was widespread \\nunemployment, and many of these people were laying off friends just to maintain the viability of their enterprises. By the end of the day, everyone was even more discouraged. \\nThe second day, we addressed the question, \"W hat\\'s going to happen in the future?\" We studied \\nenvironmental trends with the unde rlying reactive assumption that those things would create their \\nfuture. By the end of the second day, we were even  more depressed. Things were going to get worse '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nbefore they got better, and everyone knew it. \\nSo on the third day, we decided to focus on the proactive question, \"What is our response? What are \\nwe going to do? How can we exercise initiative in this situation?\" In the morning we talked about \\nmanaging and reducing costs. In the afternoon we discussed increasing market share.  We \\nbrainstormed both areas, then concentrated on several very practical, very doable things. A new spirit \\nof excitement, hope, and proactive awareness concluded the meetings. \\nAt the every end of the thir d day, we summarized the results of the conference in a three-part \\nanswer to the question, \"How\\'s business?\" \\nPart one: What\\'s happening to us is not good, an d the trends suggest that it will get worse before it \\ngets better \\nPart two: But what we are causing to happen is  very good, for we are better managing and reducing \\nour costs and increasing our market share \\nPart three: Therefore, business is better than ever \\nNow what would a reactive mind say to that? \"Oh , come on. Face facts. You can only carry this \\npositive thinking and self-psych approach so f ar. Sooner or later you have to face reality.\" \\nBut that\\'s the difference between positive thinking  and proactivity. We did face reality. We faced \\nthe reality of the current circumstance and of future projections. But we also faced the reality that we \\nhad the power to choose a positive response to those circumstances and projections. Not facing reality \\nwould have been to accept the idea that what\\'s happening in our environm ent had to determine us. \\nBusinesses, community groups, organizations of ev ery kind -- including families -- can be proactive. \\nThey can combine the creativity and resourcefulness of proactive individuals to create a proactive \\nculture within the organization. The organization does  not have to be at the mercy of the environment; \\nit can take the initiative to accomplish the shared values and purposes of the individuals involved. \\nListening to our Language \\nBecause our attitudes and behaviors flow out of our paradigms, if we use our self-awareness to \\nexamine them, we can often see in them the nature  of our underlying maps.  Our language, for \\nexample, is a very real indicator of the degr ee to which we see ourselves as proactive people. \\nThe language of reactive people  absolves them of  responsibility. \\n\"That\\'s me. That\\'s just the way I am.\" I am  determined. There\\'s nothing I can do about it. \\n\"He makes me so mad!\" I\\'m not responsible. My  emotional life is governed by something outside \\nmy control. \\n\"I can\\'t do that. I just don\\'t have the time.\"  Something outside me -- limited time -- is controlling \\nme. \\n\"If only my wife were more patient.\" Someon e else\\'s behavior is limiting my effectiveness. \\n   \"I have to do it.\" Circumstan ces or other people are forcing me to do what I do. I\\'m not free to \\nchoose my own actions. \\nReactive Language: There\\'s nothing I can do. That\\'s just the way I am. He makes me so mad. \\nThey won\\'t allow that. I have to do that.  I can\\'t.  I must.  If only. \\n   Proactive Language:  Let\\'s look at our alternat ives. I can choose a different approach. I control \\nmy own feelings. I can create an effective presen tation. I will choose an appropriate response. \\nchoose. I prefer.  I will. \\nThat language comes from a basic paradigm of determinism. And the whole spirit of it is the \\ntransfer of responsibility. I am not resp onsible, not able to choose my response. \\nOne time a student asked me, \"Will you excuse me from class? I have to go on a tennis trip.\" \\n\"You have to go, or you choose to go?\" I asked. \\n\"I really have to,\" he exclaimed. I '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\n\"What will happen if you don\\'t?\" \\n\"Why, they\\'ll kick me off the team.\" \\n\"How would you like that consequence?\" \\n   \"I wouldn\\'t.\" \\n\"In other words, you choose to go because you wa nt the consequence of stay ing on the team. What \\nwill happen if you miss my class?\" \\n   \"I don\\'t know.\" \\n   \"Think hard.  What do you think would be the natural consequence of not coming to class?\" \\n\"You wouldn\\'t kick me out, would you?\" \\n   \"That would be a social consequence.  That wo uld be artificial. If you don\\'t participate on the \\ntennis team, you don\\'t play. That\\'s natural. But if you don\\'t come to class, what would be the natural \\nconsequence?\" \\n\"I guess I\\'ll miss the learning.\" \\n   \"That\\'s right.  So you have to weigh that consequence against the other consequence and make a \\nchoice. I know if it were me, I\\'d choose to go on the tennis trip. But never say you have to do \\nanything.\" \\n\"I choose to go on the tennis trip,\" he meekly replied. \\n\"And miss my class?\" I replied in mock disbelief. \\nA serious problem with reactive language is that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. People \\nbecome reinforced in the paradigm that they are determined, and they produce evidence to support the belief. They feel increasingly victimized and out of control, not in charge of th eir life or their destiny. \\nThey blame outside forces -- other people, circumst ances, even the stars -- for their own situation. \\nAt one seminar where I was speaking on the concept of proactivity, a man came up and said, \\n\"Stephen, I like what you\\'re saying. But every situation is so different. Look at my marriage. I\\'m really worried. My wife and I just don\\'t have th e same feelings for each other we used to have. I \\nguess I just don\\'t love her anymore and she doesn\\'t love me. What can I do?\" \\n\"The feeling isn\\'t there anymore?\" I asked. \\n\"That\\'s right,\" he reaffirmed. \"And we have th ree children we\\'re really concerned about. What do \\nyou suggest?\" \\n   \"Love her,\" I replied. \\n\"I told you, the feeling just isn\\'t there anymore.\" \\n   \"Love her.\" \\n   \"You don\\'t understand.  The feeling of love just isn\\'t there.\" \\n\"Then love her. If the feeling isn\\'t th ere, that\\'s a good reason to love her.\" \\n\"But how do you love when you don\\'t love?\" \\n\"My friend, love is a verb. Love -- the feeling -- is a fruit of love the verb. So love her. Sacrifice. \\nListen to her.  Empathize. Appreciate. Affirm her. Are you willing to do that?\" \\nIn the great literature of all progressive societies, love is a verb. Reactive people make it a feeling. \\nThey\\'re driven by feelings. Hollywood has generally scripted us to believe that we are not responsible, \\nthat we are a product of our feelin gs. But the Hollywood script does not describe the reality. If our \\nfeelings control our actions, it is because we have  abdicated our responsibility and empowered them to \\ndo so. \\n   Proactive people make love a verb.  Love is something you do: the sacrifices you make, the giving \\nof self, like a mother bringing a newborn into the wo rld. If you want to study love, study those who \\nsacrifice for others, even for people who offend or do not love in return. If you are a parent, look at the \\nlove you have for the children you sacrificed for. Lo ve is a value that is actualized through loving \\nactions. Proactive people subordinate feelings to  values. Love, the feeling, can be recaptured.

Circle of Influence. \\nAnother excellent way to become more self-aware  regarding our own degree of proactivity is to look \\nat where we focus our time and energy. We each have a wide range of concerns -- our health, our \\nchildren, problems at work, the national debt, nucl ear war. We could separate those from things in \\nwhich we have no particular mental or emotional involvement by creating a \"Circle of Concern. \\nAs we look at those things within our Circle of  Concern, it becomes apparent that there are some \\nthings over which we have no real control and others that we can do something about. We could \\nidentify those concerns in the latter group by circumsc ribing them within a smaller Circle of Influence. \\nBy determining which of these two circles is the focu s of most of our time and energy, we can discover \\nmuch about the degree of our proactivity. \\nProactive people focus their efforts in the Circle of Influence.  They work on the things they can do \\nsomething about. The nature of their energy is positive, enlarging and ma gnifying, causing their \\nCircle of Influence to increase. \\nReactive people, on the other hand, focus their e fforts in the Circle of Concern. They focus on the \\nweakness of other people, the problems in the envi ronment, and circumstances over which they have \\nno control. Their focus results in blaming and accusing attitudes,  reactive language, and increased \\nfeelings of victimization. The negative energy generat ed by that focus, combined with neglect in areas \\nthey could do something about, causes their Circle of Influence to shrink. \\nAs long as we are working in ou r Circle of Concern, we empower the things within it to control us. \\nWe aren\\'t taking the proactive initiative necessary to effect positive change. \\nEarlier, I shared with you the story of my son who was having serious problems in school. Sandra \\nand I were deeply concerned about his apparent weaknesses and about the way other people were \\ntreating him. \\nBut those things were in our Circle of Concern. As long as we focused our efforts on those things, \\nwe accomplished nothing, except to increase our ow n feelings of inadequacy and helplessness and to \\nreinforce our son\\'s dependence. \\nIt was only when we went to work in our Ci rcle of Influence, when we focused on our own \\nparadigms, that we began to create a positive energy that changed ourselves and eventually influenced \\nour son as well. By working on ourselves inst ead of worrying about cond itions, we were able to \\ninfluence the conditions. \\nBecause of position, wealth, role, or relationship s, there are some circumst ances in which a person\\'s \\nCircle of Influence is larger than  his or her Circle of Concern. \\nThis situation reflects on a self-inflicted emotional myopia -- another re active selfish life-style \\nfocused in the Circle of Concern. \\nThough they may have to prioritize the use of their influence, proactive people have a Circle of \\nConcern that is at least as big as their Circle of Influence, accepting the responsibility to use their influence effectively. \\nDirect, Indirect, and No Control \\nThe problems we face fall in one of three areas: direct control (problems involving our own \\nbehavior); indirect control (problems involving other people\\'s behavior); or no control (problems we can \\ndo nothing about, such as our past or situational realities). The proactive approach puts the first step \\nin the solution of all three kinds of problems within our present Circle of Influence. \\nDirect control problems are solved by working on  our habits. They are obviously within our Circle \\nof Influence. These are the \"Private Victories\" of Habits 1, 2, and 3. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 39}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nIndirect control problems are solved by changi ng our methods of influence. These are the \"Public \\nVictories\" of Habits 4, 5, and 6. I have personally identified over 30 separate methods of human \\ninfluence -- as separate as empathy is from confront ation, as separate as example is from persuasion. \\nM o s t  p e o p l e  h a v e  o n l y  t h r e e  o r  f o u r  o f  t h e s e methods in their repertoire, starting usually with \\nreasoning, and, if that doesn\\'t work, moving to flight  or fight. How liberating it is to accept the idea \\nthat I can learn new methods of human influence inst ead of constantly trying to use old ineffective \\nmethods to \"shape up\" someone else! \\nNo control problems involve taking the responsib ility to change the line on the bottom on our face -- \\nto smile, to genuinely and peacefully  accept these problems and learn to live with them, even though \\nwe don\\'t like them. In this way, we do not empower these problems to control us. We share in the \\nspirit embodied in the Alcoholics Anonymous prayer, \"Lord, give me the courage to change the things \\nwhich can and ought to be changed, the serenity to accept the things which cannot be changed, and the \\nwisdom to know the difference.\" \\nWhether a problem is direct, indirect, or no control, we have in our hands the first step to the \\nsolution. Changing our habits, changing our methods of influenc e and changing the way we see our \\nno control problems are all with in our Circle of Influence. \\nExpanding the Circle of Influence \\nIt is inspiring to realize that in choosing ou r response to circumstance, we powerfully affect our \\ncircumstance. When we change one part of the chemical formula, we ch ange the nature of the results \\nI worked with one organization for several years  that was headed by a very dynamic person. He \\ncould read trends. He was creative, talented, capable, and brilliant -- and everyone knew it. But he had a very dictatorial style of management. He tended  to treat people like \"gofers,\" as if they didn\\'t \\nhave any judgment. His manner of speaking to those who worked in the organization was, \"Go for \\nthis; go for that; now do this; now do that -- I\\'ll make the decisions. \\nThe net effect was that he alienated almost the entire executive team surrounding him.  They would \\ngather in the corridors and complain to each other about him.  Their discussion was all very \\nsophisticated, very articulate, as if they were trying to help the situation. But they did it endlessly, \\nabsolving themselves of responsibility in the name of the president\\'s weaknesses. \\n\"You can\\'t imagine what\\'s happened this time,\" someone would say. \"The other day he went into \\nmy department. I had everything all laid out. But he came in and gave totally different signals. \\nEverything I\\'d done for months was shot, just lik e that. I don\\'t know how I\\'m supposed to keep \\nworking for him. How long will it be until he retires?\" \\n\"He\\'s only fifty-nine,\" someone else would respond. \"Do you think you can survive for six more \\nyears?\" \\n   \"I don\\'t know.  He\\'s the kind of pe rson they probably won\\'t retire anyway.\" \\nBut one of the executives was proactive. He was driven by values, not feelings. He took initiative \\n-- he anticipated, he empathized, he read the situatio n. He was not blind to the president\\'s weaknesses; \\nbut instead of criticizing them, he would compensa te for them. Where the president was weak in his \\nstyle, he\\'d try to buffer his own people and make su ch weaknesses irrelevant. And he\\'d work with the \\npresident\\'s strengths -- his vision, talent, creativity. \\nThis man focused on his Circle of Influence. He was treated like a gofer, also. But he would do \\nmore than what was expected. He anticipated th e president\\'s need.  He read with empathy the \\npresident\\'s underlying concern, so when he presente d information, he also gave his analysis and his \\nrecommendations based on that analysis. \\nAs I sat one day with the president in an adviso ry capacity, he said, \"Stephen, I just can\\'t believe \\nwhat this man has done. He\\'s not only given me  the information I requested, but he\\'s provided '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 40}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nadditional information that\\'s exactl y what we needed. He even gave me his analysis of it in terms of \\nmy deepest concerns, and a list of his recommendations. \\n\"The recommendations are consistent with the analysis, and the analysis is consistent with the data. \\nHe\\'s remarkable! What a relief not to have to worry about this part of the business.\" \\nAt the next meeting, it was \"go for this\" and \"go for that\" to all the executives but one. To this man, \\nit was \"What\\'s your opinion?\" His Circle of Influence had grown \\nThis caused quite a stir in the organization. The reactive minds in the executive corridors began \\nshooting their vindictive ammuni tion at this proactive man. \\nIt\\'s the nature of reactive people to absolve themse lves of responsibility. It\\'s  so much safer to say, \"I \\nam not responsible.\" If I say \"I am responsible,\" I mi ght have to say, \"I am irresponsible.\" It would be \\nvery hard for me to say that I have the power to  choose my response and that the response I have \\nchosen has resulted in my involvement in a negative , collusive environment, especially if for years I \\nhave absolved myself of responsibility for results in the name of someone else\\'s weaknesses. \\nSo these executives focused on finding more in formation, more ammunition, more evidence as to \\nwhy they weren\\'t responsible. \\nBut this man was proactive toward them, too. Little by little, his Circle of Influence toward them \\ngrew also. It continued to expand to the extent th at eventually no one made any significant moves in \\nthe organization without that man\\'s involvement an d approval, including the president.  But the \\npresident did not feel threatened because this man\\'s strength complemented his strength and \\ncompensated for his weaknesses. So he had the strength of two people, a complementary team. \\nThis man\\'s success was not dependent on his circumstances.  Many others were in the same \\nsituation. It was his chosen response to those circumstances, his focus on his Ci rcle of Influence, that \\nmade the difference. \\nThere are some people who interpret \"proactive\" to  mean pushy, aggressive, or insensitive; but that \\nisn\\'t the case at all. Proactive people aren\\'t push y. They\\'re smart, they\\'re value driven, they read \\nreality, and they know what\\'s needed. \\nLook at Gandhi. While his accusers were in the legislative chambers criticizing him because he \\nwouldn\\'t join in their Circle of Concern rhetoric co ndemning the British Empire for their subjugation of \\nthe Indian people, Gandhi was out in the rice pa ddies, quietly, slowly, imperceptibly expanding his \\nCircle of Influence with the field laborers. A ground  swell of support, of trust, of confidence followed \\nhim through the countryside. Though he held no office or political posi tion, through compassion, \\ncourage, fasting, and moral persua sion he eventually brought England to its knees, breaking political \\ndomination of 300 million people with the power of  his greatly expanded Circle of Influence. \\nThe \"Have\\'s\" and the \"Be\\'s\" \\n   One wa y to determine which circle our concern is in is to distin guish between the have \\'s and the be\\'s. \\nThe Circle of Concern is filled with the have\\'s \\n\"I\\'ll be happy when I have my house paid off.\" \\n\" I f  o n l y  I  h a d  a  b o s s  w h o wasn\\'t such a dictator.\" \\n\"If only I had a more patient husband.\" \\n\"If I had more obedient kids.\" \\n\"If I had my degree.\" \\n\"If I could just have more time to myself.\" \\nThe Circle of Influence is filled with the be\\'s -- I can be more patient, be wise, be loving. It\\'s the \\ncharacter focus. \\nAnytime we think the problem is \"out there,\" that  thought is the problem. We empower what\\'s out \\nthere to control us. The change paradigm is \"outside-in\" -- what\\'s out there has to change before we '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 41}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\ncan change. \\nThe proactive approach is to change from the In side-Out: to be different, and by being different, to \\neffect positive change in what\\'s out there -- I can be  more resourceful, I can be more diligent, I can be \\nmore creative, I can be more cooperative. \\n   O n e  o f  m y  f a v o r i t e  s t o r i e s  i s  o n e  i n  t h e  O l d  T e s t a m e n t ,  p a r t  o f  t h e  f u n d a m e n t a l  f a b r i c  o f  t h e \\nJudeo-Christian tradition. It\\'s the story of Joseph, who was sold into slavery in Egypt by his brothers \\nat the age of 17. Can you imagine how easy it would have been for him to languish in self-pity as a \\nservant of Potiphar, to focus on the weaknesses of his brothers and his ca ptors and on all he didn\\'t have? \\nBut Joseph was proactive. He worked on be. An d within a short period of time, he was running \\nPotiphar\\'s household. He was in charge of all that Potiphar had because the trust was so high. \\nThen the day came when Joseph was caught in a difficult situation and refused to compromise his \\nintegrity. As a result, he was unjustly imprisoned  for 13 years. But again he was proactive. He \\nworked on the inner circle, on being instead of having, and soon he was running the prison and \\neventually the entire nation of Eg ypt, second only to the Pharaoh. \\nI know this idea is a dramatic  Paradigm Shift for many people. It is so much easier to blame other \\npeople, conditioning, or conditions for our own stagnant situation.  But we are responsible --\\n\"response-able\" -- to control our lives and to powerful ly influence our circumstances by working on be, \\non what we are. \\nIf I have a problem in my marriage, what do I re ally gain by continually confessing my wife\\'s sins? \\nBy saying I\\'m not responsible, I make myself a powerless victim; I immobilize myself in a negative \\nsituation. I also diminish my ability to influence her -- my nagging, accusing, critical attitude only \\nmakes her feel validated in her own weakness. My criticism is worse than the conduct I want to \\ncorrect. My ability to positively im pact the situation withers and dies. \\nIf I really want to improve my situation, I can work on the one thing over which I have control -- \\nmyself. I can stop trying to shap e up my wife and work on my own weaknesses. I can focus on being \\na great marriage partner, a source of unconditional love and support.  Hopefully , my wife will feel the \\npower of proactive example and respond in kind. Bu t whether she does or doesn\\'t, the most positive \\nway I can influence my situation is to work on myself, on my being. \\nThere are so many ways to work in the Circle of Influence -- to be a better listener, to be a more \\nloving marriage partner, to be a better student, to  be a more cooperative and dedicated employee. \\nSometimes the most proactive thing we can do is to be happy, just to genuinely smile. Happiness, like unhappiness, is a proactive choice. There are things, like the weather, th at our Circle of Influence will \\nnever include. But as proactive people, we can carry our own physical or social weather with us. We \\ncan be happy and accept those things that at presen t we can\\'t control, while we focus our efforts on the \\nthings that we can. \\nThe Other End of the Stick \\nBefore we totally shift our life focus to our Circle of Influence, we need to consider two things in our \\nCircle of Concern that merit deeper thought -- consequences and mistakes. \\nWhile we are free to choose our actions, we are not free to choose the consequences of those actions. \\nConsequences are governed by natural law. They are out in the Circle of Conc ern. We can decide to \\nstep in front of a fast-moving train, but we canno t decide what will happen when the train hits us. \\nWe can decide to be dishonest in our business dealings. While the social consequences of that \\ndecision may vary depending on whether or not we are found out, the natural consequences to our \\nbasic character are a fixed result. \\nOur behavior is governed by principles.  Living in harmony with them brings positive \\nconsequences; violating them brings negative conseq uences. We are free to choose our response in any '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 42}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nsituation, but in doing so, we choose the attendant consequence. \"When we pick up one end of the \\nstick, we pick up the other.\" \\nUndoubtedly, there have been times in each of our lives when we have picked up what we later felt \\nwas the wrong stick. Our choices have brought cons equences we would rather have lived without. If \\nwe had the choice to make over again, we would make  it differently. We call these choices mistakes, \\nand they are the second thing that merits our deeper thought. \\nFor those filled with regret, perhaps the most needful exercise of proactivity is to realize that past \\nmistakes are also out there in the Circle of Concer n. We can\\'t recall them, we can\\'t undo them, we can\\'t \\ncontrol the consequences that came as a result. \\nAs a college quarterback, one of my sons learned  to snap his wristband between plays as a kind of \\nmental checkoff whenever he or anyone made a \"se tting back\" mistake, so the last mistake wouldn\\'t \\naffect the resolve and execution of the next play. \\nThe proactive approach to a mistake is to acknow ledge it instantly, correct it, and learn from it. \\nThis literally turns a failure into a success. \"Success,\" said IBM founder T. J. Watson, \"is on the far \\nside of failure.\" \\nBut not to acknowledge a mistake, not to correct it and learn from it, is a mist ake of a different order. \\nIt usually puts a person on a self-deceiving, self-j ustifying path, often involving rationalization (rational \\nlies) to self and to others.  This second mistak e, this cover-up, empowers the first, giving it \\ndisproportionate importance, and ca uses far deeper injury to self. \\nIt is not what others do or even our own mistakes that hurt us the most; it is our response to those \\nthings. Chasing after the poisonous snake that bite s us will only drive the poison through our entire \\nsystem. It is far better to take measures immediately to get the poison out. \\nOur response to any mistake affects the quality of  the next moment. It is important to immediately \\nadmit and correct our mistakes so that they have  no power over that next moment and we are \\nempowered again. \\nMaking and Keeping Commitments \\nAt the very heart of our Circle of Influenc e is our ability to make and keep commitments and \\npromises. The commitments we make to ourselves and to others, and our integrity to those commitments, is the essence and clearest  manifestation of our proactivity. \\n   It is also the essence of  our growth.  Through our human endowments of self-awareness and \\nconscience, we become conscious of areas of weakness, areas for improvement, areas of talent that could \\nbe developed, areas that need to be changed or e liminated from our lives. Then, as we recognize and \\nuse our imagination and independent will to act on that awareness -- making promises, setting goals, \\nand being true to them -- we build the strength of character, the being, that makes possible every other positive thing in our lives. \\nIt is here that we find two ways to put ourselve s in control of our lives immediately. We can make \\na promise -- and keep it. Or we can set a goal -- and work to achieve it. As we make and keep \\ncommitments, even small commitments, we begin to establish an inner integr ity that gives us the \\nawareness of self-control and the courage and strength  to accept more of the responsibility for our own \\nlives. By making and keeping promises to ourselves and others, little by little, our honor becomes greater than our moods. \\nThe power to make and keep commitments to ours elves is the essence of developing the basic habits \\nof effectiveness. Knowledge, skill, and desire are a ll within our control. We can work on any one to \\nimprove the balance of the three. As the area of intersection becomes larger, we more deeply \\ninternalize the principles upon which the habits are based and create the strength of character to move \\nus in a balanced way toward increasing effectiveness in our lives.

It is in the ordinary events of every day that we develop the proactive capacity to handle \\nthe extraordinary pressures of life. It\\'s how we ma ke and keep commitments, how we handle a traffic \\njam, how we respond to an irate customer or a diso bedient child. It\\'s how we view our problems and \\nwhere we focus our energies. It\\'s the language we use. \\nI would challenge you to test the principle of proactivity for 30 days. Simply try it and see what \\nhappens. For 30 days work only in your Circle of Influence. Make small commitments and keep them. Be a light, not a judge. Be a model, not a critic. Be part of the solution, not part of the \\nproblem. \\nTry it in your marriage, in your family, in yo ur job. Don\\'t argue for other people\\'s weaknesses. \\nDon\\'t argue for your own. When you make a mistake, admit it, correct it, and learn from it -\\xad\\nimmediately. Don\\'t get into a blaming, accusing mode.  Work on things you have control over. \\nWork on you. On be. \\nLook at the weaknesses of others with compassi on, not accusation. It\\'s not what they\\'re not doing \\nor should be doing that\\'s the issue. The issue is your own chos en response to the situation and what \\nyou should be doing. If you start to think the prob lem is \"out there,\" stop yourself. That thought is \\nthe problem. \\nPeople who exercise their embryonic freedom day af ter day will, little by little, expand that freedom. \\nPeople who do not will find that it withers until they are literally \"being lived.\" They are acting out the \\nscripts written by parents, associates, and society. \\nWe are responsible for our own effectiveness, for our own happiness, and ultimately, I would say, \\nfor most of our circumstances. \\nSamuel Johnson observed: \"The fountain of conten t must spring up in the mind, and he who hath so \\nlittle knowledge of human nature as to seek happiness by changing anything but his own disposition, \\nwill waste his life in fruitless efforts and mu ltiply the grief he proposes to remove.\" \\nKnowing that we are responsible -- \"response-able \" -- is fundamental to effectiveness and to every \\nother habit of effectiveness we will discuss. \\nApplication Suggestions \\n1. For a full day, listen to your language and to the language of the people around you. How \\noften do you use and hear reactive phrases such  as \"If only,\" \"I can\\'t,\" or \"I have to\" \\n2. Identify an experience you might encounter in the near future where, based on past experience, \\nyou would probably behave reactively. Review the situat ion in the context of your Circle of Influence. \\nHow could you respond proactively? Take several mo ments and create the experience vividly in your \\nmind, picturing yourself responding in a proactive manner. Remind yourself of the gap between \\nstimulus and response. Make a commitment to yourself to exercise your freedom to choose. \\n3. Select a problem from your work or personal  life that is frustrating to you. Determine whether \\nit is a direct, indirect, or no control problem. Iden tify the first step you can take in your Circle of \\nInfluence to solve it and then take that step.\\n 4. Try the 30-day test of proactivity.  Be aw are of the change in your Circle of Influence.

Clear \\nyour mind of everything except what you will read and what I will invite you to do. Don\\'t worry \\nabout your schedule, your business, your family, or your friends. Just focus with me and really open \\nyour mind. \\nIn your mind\\'s eye, see yourself going to the funeral parlor or chapel, parking the car, and getting \\nout. As you walk inside the building, you notice th e flowers, the soft organ music. You see the faces \\nof friends and family you pass along the way. You feel the shared sorrow of lo sing, the joy of having \\nknown, that radiates from the hearts of the people there. \\nAs you walk down to the front of the room an d look inside the casket, you suddenly come face to \\nface with yourself. This is your funeral, three years  from today. All these people have come to honor \\nyou, to express feelings of love and appreciation for your life. \\nAs you take a seat and wait for the services to begin, you look at the program in your hand. There \\nare to be four speakers. The first one is from yo ur family, immediate and al so extended -- children, \\nbrothers, sisters, nephews, nieces, aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents who have come from all \\nover the country to attend. The second speaker is one of your friends, someone who can give a sense \\nof what you were as a person. The third speaker is from your work or profession. And the fourth is \\nfrom your church or some community organization where you\\'ve been involved in service. \\nNow think deeply. What would you like each of  these speakers to say about you and your life? \\nWhat kind of husband, wife, father, or mother would you like their words to reflect? What kind of son or daughter or cousin? What kind of friend? What kind of working associate? \\nWhat character would you like them to have seen  in you? What contributi ons, what achievements \\nwould you want them to remember? Look carefully at the people around you. What difference would \\nyou like to have made in their lives? \\nBefore you read further, take a few minutes to jo t down your impressions. It will greatly increase \\nyour personal understanding of Habit 2. \\nWhat it Means to \"Begin with the End in Mind\" \\nIf you participated seriously in this visuali zation experience, you touched for a moment some of \\nyour deep, fundamental values. You established brie f contact with that inner guidance system at the \\nheart of your Circle of Influence \\nConsider the words of Joseph Addison: \\nWhen I look upon the tombs of the great, ev ery emotion of envy dies in me; when I read the \\nepitaphs of the beautiful, every inordinate desire goes  out; when I meet with th e grief of parents upon a \\ntombstone, my heart melts with co mpassion; when I see the tomb of the parents themselves, I consider \\nthe vanity of grieving for those whom we must quickly follow: when  I see kings lying by those who \\ndeposed them, I consider rival wits placed side by side, or the holy men that divided the world with \\ntheir contests and disputes, I reflect with sorrow an d astonishment on the little competitions, factions, \\nand debates of mankind. When I read the several dates of the tombs, of some that died yesterday, and \\nsome six hundred years ago, I consider that great Day when we shall all of us be Contemporaries, and \\nmake our appearance together. \\nAlthough Habit 2 applies to many different circ umstances and levels of lif e, the most fundamental '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 45}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\napplication of \"Begin with the End in Mind\" is to be gin today with the image, picture, or paradigm of \\nthe end of your life as your frame of reference or the criterion by which everything else is examined. \\nEach part of your life -- today\\'s behavior, tomorro w\\'s behavior, next week\\'s behavior, next month\\'s \\nbehavior -- can be examined in the context of the whole, of what really matters most to you. By \\nkeeping that end clearly in mind, you can make ce rtain that whatever you do on any particular day \\ndoes not violate the criteria you have defined as su premely important, and that each day of your life \\ncontributes in a meaningful way to the vi sion you have of your life as a whole. \\nTo Begin with the End in Mind  means to start with a clear unders tanding of your destination. It \\nmeans to know where you\\'re going so that you bette r understand where you are now and so that the \\nsteps you take are always in the right direction. \\nIt\\'s incredibly easy to get caught up in an acti vity trap, in the busy-ness of  life, to work harder and \\nharder at climbing the ladder of success only to disc over it\\'s leaning against the wrong wall. It is \\npossible to be busy -- very busy -- without being very effective. \\nPeople often find themselves achieving victorie s that are empty, successes that have come at the \\nexpense of things they suddenly realize were far mo re valuable to them. People from every walk of \\nlife -- doctors, academicians, actors, politicians, busi ness professionals, athletes, and plumbers -- often \\nstruggle to achieve a higher income, more recognitio n or a certain degree of professional competence, \\nonly to find that their drive to achieve their goal blinded them to th e things that really mattered most \\nand now are gone. \\nHow different our lives are when we really know what is deeply important to us, and, keeping that \\npicture in mind, we manage ourselves each day to be and to do what really matters most. If the ladder \\nis not leaning against the right wall, every step we take  just gets us to the wrong place faster. We may \\nbe very busy, we may be very efficient, but we will also be truly effect ive only when we Begin with the \\nEnd in Mind. \\nIf you carefully consider what you wanted to be said of you in the funeral experience, you will find \\nyour definition of success. It may be very different  from the definition you thought you had in mind. \\nPerhaps fame, achievement, money, or some of the other things we strive for are not even part of the \\nright wall. \\nWhen you Begin with the End in Mind, you gain  a different perspective. One man asked another \\non the death of a mutual friend, \"How much did he  leave?\" His friend responded, \"He left it all.\" \\nAll Things Are Created Twice \\n\"Begin with the End in Mind\" is based on the pr inciple that all things are created twice. There\\'s a \\nmental or first creation, and a physical  or second creation to all things \\nTake the construction of a home, for example. You create it in every detail before you ever hammer \\nthe first nail into place. You try to get a very cle ar sense of what kind of house you want. If you want \\na family-centered home, you plan a family room wh ere it would be a natural gathering place. You \\nplan sliding doors and a patio for children to play outside. You work with ideas. You work with \\nyour mind until you get a clear image of what you want to build. \\nThen you reduce it to blueprint and develop constr uction plans. All of this  is done before the earth \\nis touched. If not, then in the second creation, the physical creation, you will have to make expensive \\nchanges that may double the cost of your home. \\nThe carpenter\\'s rule is \"measure twice, cut once.\"  You have to make sure th at the blueprint, the first \\ncreation, is really what you want, that you\\'ve though t everything through. Then  you put it into bricks \\nand mortar. Each day you go to the construction shed and pull out the blueprint to get marching \\norders for the day. You Begin with the End in Mind. \\nFor another example, look at a business. If you want to have a successful enterprise, you clearly '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 46}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\ndefine what you\\'re trying to accomplish. You care fully think through the product or service you want \\nto provide in terms of your market target, then you organize all the elements -- financial, research and \\ndevelopment, operations, marketing, pe rsonnel, physical facilities, and so on -- to meet that objective. \\nThe extent to which you Begin with the End in Mind  often determines whether or not you are able to \\ncreate a successful enterprise. Most business failures begin in the first creation, with problems such as \\nundercapitalization, misunderstanding of the market, or lack of a business plan. \\nThe same is true with parentin g. If you want to raise responsi ble, self-disciplined children, you \\nhave to keep that end clearly in mind as you interact with your children on a daily basis. You can\\'t \\nbehave toward them in ways that underm ine their self-discipline or self-esteem. \\nTo varying degrees, people use this principle in  many different areas of lif e. Before you go on a \\ntrip, you determine your destination and plan out the best route. Before you plant a garden, you plan \\nit out in your mind, possibly on paper. You crea te speeches on paper before you give them, you \\nenvision the landscaping in your yard before you la ndscape it, you design the clothes you make before \\nyou thread the needle. \\nTo the extent to which we understand the princi ple of two creations and a ccept the responsibility for \\nboth, we act within and enlarge the bo rders of our Circle of Influence. To the extent to which we do \\nnot operate in harmony with this principle and ta ke charge of the first creation, we diminish it. \\nBy Design or Default \\nIt\\'s a principle that all things are created twice, but not all first creations are by conscious design. In \\nour personal lives, if we do not develop our own self-awareness and become responsible for first creations, we empower other people and circumstance s outside our Circle or Influence to shape much \\nof our lives by default. We reactively live the scripts  handed to us by family, associates, other people\\'s \\nagendas, the pressures of circum stance -- scripts from our earlier years, from our training, our \\nconditioning \\nThese scripts come from people, not principles. And they rise out of our deep vulnerabilities, our \\ndeep dependency on others and our need for acceptance and love, for belonging, for a sense of importance and worth, for a feeling that we matter. \\nWhether we are aware of it or not, whether we are in  control of it or not, there is a first creation to \\nevery part of our lives. We are either the second creation of our own proactive design, or we are the second creation of other people\\'s agendas, of circumstances, or of past habits \\nThe unique human capacities of self-awareness, imagination, and conscience enable us to examine \\nfirst creations and make it possible for us to take charge of our own first creation, to write our own \\nscript. Put another way, Habit 1 says, \"You are  the creator.\" Habit 2 is the first creation. \\nLeadership and Management -- The Two Creations \\nHabit 2 is based on principles of personal leadership, which means that leadership is the first \\ncreation. Leadership is not management. Manage ment is the second crea tion, which we\\'ll discuss in \\nthe chapter on Habit 3. But le adership has to come first. \\nManagement is a bottom-line focus: How can I best accomplish certain things? Leadership deals \\nwith the top line: What are the things I want to accomplish? In the words of both Peter Drucker and Warren Bennis, \"Management is doing th ings right; leadership is doin g the right things.\" Management \\nis efficiency in climbing the ladder of success; leadership determines whether the ladder is leaning \\nagainst the right wall.\\n You can quickly grasp the important differenc e between the two if you envision a group of \\nproducers cutting their way through the jungle with  machetes. They\\'re the producers, the problem '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 47}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nsolvers. They\\'re cutting through the undergrowth, clearing it out. \\nThe managers are behind them, sharpening thei r machetes, writing policy and procedure manuals, \\nholding muscle development programs, bringing in improved technologies, and setting up working \\nschedules and compensation programs for machete wielders. \\nThe leader is the one who climbs the tallest tr ee, surveys the entire situ ation, and yells, \"Wrong \\njungle!\" \\nBut how do the busy, efficient producers and managers often respond? \"Shut up! We\\'re making \\nprogress.\" \\nAs individuals, groups, and businesses, we\\'re often so busy cutting through the undergrowth we \\ndon\\'t even realize we\\'re in the wr ong jungle. And the rapidly changing environment in which we live \\nmakes effective leadership more critical than it has ever been -- in every aspect of independent and \\ninterdependent life. \\nWe are more in need of a vision or designation and a compass (a set of principles or directions) and \\nless in need of a road map. We often don\\'t know what the terrain ahead will be like or what we will \\nneed to go through it; much will depend on our judgment at the time. But an inner compass will always give us direction. \\nEffectiveness -- often even survival -- does not depend solely on how much effort we expend, but on \\nwhether or not the effort we expend is in the righ t jungle. And the metamorphosis taking place in \\nmost every industry and profession demand s leadership first and management second. \\nIn business, the market is changing so rapidly th at many products and servic es that successfully met \\nconsumer tastes and needs a few years ago are obsolete today. Proactive powerful leadership must \\nconstantly monitor environmental change, particul arly customer buying habits and motives, and \\nprovide the force necessary to organize resources in the right direction. \\n   Such changes as deregulation of the airline industry, skyrocketing costs of health care, and the great \\nquality and quantity of imported cars impact the envi ronment in significant ways. If industries do not \\nmonitor the environment, including their own work team s, and exercise the creative leadership to keep \\nheaded in the right direction, no amount of ma nagement expertise can keep them from failing. \\nEfficient management without effective lead ership is, as one individual phrased it, \"like \\nstraightening deck chairs on the Titanic.\" No ma nagement success can compensate for failure in \\nleadership. But leadership is hard because we\\'re often caught in a management paradigm. \\nAt the final session of a year-long executive development program in Seattle, the president of an oil \\ncompany came up to me and said, \"Stephen, when you pointed out the difference between leadership \\nand management in the second month, I looked at  my role as the presid ent of this company and \\nrealized that I had never been into leadership. I was deep into management, buried by pressing \\nchallenges and the details of day-to-day logistics. So I decided to withdraw from management. \\ncould get other people to do that. I wanted to really lead my organization. \\n\"It was hard. I went through withdrawal pains be cause I stopped dealing with a lot of the pressing, \\nurgent matters that were right in front of me and wh ich gave me a sense of immediate accomplishment. \\nI didn\\'t receive much satisfaction as I started wres tling with the direction is sues, the culture-building \\nissues, the deep analysis of problems, the seizing of new opportunities. Others also went through \\nwithdrawal pains from their working style comfort zones. They missed the easy accessibility I had \\ngiven them before. They still wanted me to be av ailable to them, to respond, to help solve their \\nproblems on a day-to-day basis. \\n   \"But I persisted.  I was absolutely convinced that I needed to provide leadership. And I did. \\nToday our whole business is different. We\\'re more in line with our environment. We have doubled \\nour revenues and quadrupled our profits. I\\'m into leadership.\" \\nI\\'m convinced that too often parents are also trapped in the management paradigm, thinking of \\ncontrol, efficiency, and rules instead of direction, purpose, and family feeling. I '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 48}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nAnd leadership is even more lacking in our pe rsonal lives. We\\'re into managing with efficiency, \\nsetting and achieving goals before we have even clarified our values. \\nRescripting: Becoming Your Own First Creator \\nAs we previously observed, proactivity is based on the unique human endowment of self-awareness. \\nThe two additional unique human endowments that enable us to expand our proactivity and to exercise \\npersonal leadership in our lives are imagination and conscience. \\nThrough imagination, we can visualize the uncreated worlds of potential that lie within us. \\nThrough conscience, we can come in contact with univ ersal laws or principles with our own singular \\ntalents and avenues of contribution, and with th e personal guidelines within which we can most \\neffectively develop them.  Combined with self-aw areness, these two endowmen ts empower us to write \\nour own script. \\nBecause we already live with many scripts that ha ve been handed to us, the process of writing our \\nown script is actually more a process of \"rescripting,\"  or Paradigm Shifting -- of changing some of the \\nbasic paradigms that we already have. As we reco gnize the ineffective scripts, the incorrect or \\nincomplete paradigms within us, we can pr oactively begin to rescript ourselves. \\nI think one of the most inspiring accounts of the rescripting process comes from the autobiography \\nof Anwar Sadat, past president of Egypt. Sadat ha d been reared, nurtured, an d deeply scripted in a \\nhatred for Israel. He would make the statement on national television, \"I will never shake the hand of \\na n  I s r a e l i  a s  l o n g  a s  t h e y  o c c u p y  o n e  i n ch  o f  A rab soil. Never, never, never!\" And huge crowds all \\naround the country would chant, \"Never, never, neve r!\" He marshaled the energy and unified the will \\nof the whole country in that script. \\nThe script was very independent and nationalistic,  and it aroused deep emotions in the people. But \\nit was also very foolish, and Sadat knew it. It igno red the perilous, highly interdependent reality of the \\nsituation. \\nSo he rescripted himself. It was a process he  had learned when he was a young man imprisoned in \\nCell 54, a solitary cell in Cairo Central Prison, as a resu lt of his involvement in a conspiracy plot against \\nKing Farouk. He learned to withdraw from his ow n mind and look at it to see if the scripts were \\nappropriate and wise. He learned how to vacate hi s own mind and, through a deep personal process \\nof meditation, to work with his own scriptures,  his own form of prayer, and rescript himself. \\nHe records that he was almost loath to leave his prison cell because it was there that he realized that \\nreal success is success with self. It\\'s not in having  things, but in having mastery, having victory over \\nself. \\nFor a period of time during Nasser\\'s administrat ion Sadat was relegated to a position of relative \\ninsignificance. Everyone felt that his spirit was br oken, but it wasn\\'t. They were projecting their own \\nhome movies onto him. They didn\\'t understand him. He was biding his time. \\nAnd when that time came, when  he became president of Egypt and confronted the political realities, \\nhe rescripted himself toward Israel. He visited th e Knesset in Jerusalem and opened up one of the \\nmost precedent-breaking peace moveme nts in the history of the world, a bold initiative that eventually \\nbrought about the Camp David Accord. \\nSadat was able to use his self-awareness, his im agination, and his conscien ce to exercise personal \\nleadership, to change an essential paradigm, to change the way he saw the situation. He worked in the \\ncenter of his Circle of Influence. And from that rescripting, that change in  paradigm, flowed changes \\nin behavior and attitude that affected millions  of lives in the wider Circle of Concern. \\nIn developing our own self-awareness many of  us discover ineffective scripts, deeply embedded \\nhabits that are totally unworthy of us, totally incongruent with the things  we really value in life. Habit \\n2 says we don\\'t have to live with those scripts. We are response-able to use our imagination and '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 49}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\ncreativity to write new ones that are more effective, more congruent with our deepest values and with \\nthe correct principles that give our values meaning. \\nSuppose, for example, that I am highly overreac tive to my children. Suppose that whenever they \\nbegin to do something I feel is inappropriate, I sens e an immediate tensing in the pit of my stomach. I \\nfeel defensive walls go up; I prepare for battle.  My focus is not on th e long-term growth and \\nunderstanding but on the short-term behavior. I\\'m trying to win the battle, not the war. \\nI pull out my ammunition -- my superior size, my position of authority -- and I yell or intimidate or I \\nthreaten or punish. And I win. I stand there, vi ctorious, in the middle of the debris of a shattered \\nrelationship while my children are outwardly submissive and inwardly rebellious, suppressing feelings \\nthat will come out later in uglier ways. \\nNow if I were sitting at that funeral we visualized earlier, and one of my children was about to \\nspeak, I would want his life to represent the victor y of teaching, training, an d disciplining with love \\nover a period of years rather than the battle scars of  quick-fix skirmishes. I would want his heart and \\nmind to be filled with the pleasant memories of deep, meaningful times together. I would want him to remember me as a loving father who shared the fun and the pain of growing up. I would want him to \\nremember the times he came to me  with his problems and concerns. I would want to have listened \\nand loved and helped. I would want him to know I wa sn\\'t perfect, but that I had tried with everything \\nI had. And that, perhaps more than anybody in the world, I loved him. \\nThe reason I would want those things is becaus e, deep down, I value my children. I love them, I \\nwant to help them. I value my role as their father. \\nBut I don\\'t always see those values. I get caught up in the \"thick of thin things.\" What matters most \\ngets buried under layers of pressing problems, im mediate concerns, and outward behaviors. I become \\nreactive. And the way I interact with my children ev ery day often bears little resemblance to the way I \\ndeeply feel about them. \\nBecause I am self-aware, because I have imag ination and conscience, I can examine my deepest \\nvalues. I can realize that the script I\\'m living is no t in harmony with those values, that my life is not \\nthe product of my own proactive design, but the re sult of the first creation I have deferred to \\ncircumstances and other people. And I can change. I can live out of my imagination instead of my \\nmemory. I can tie myself to my limitless potential instead of my limiting past. I can become my own \\nfirst creator. \\nTo Begin with the End in Mind means to approach  my role as a parent, as well as my other roles in \\nlife, with my values and directions clear. It mean s to be responsible for my own first creation, to \\nrescript myself so that the paradigms from which my behavior and attitude flow are congruent with my \\ndeepest values and in harmony with correct principles. \\nIt also means to begin each day with those values  firmly in mind. Then as the vicissitudes, as the \\nchallenges come, I can make my decisions based on those values.  I can act with integrity.  I don\\'t \\nhave to react to the emotion, the circumstance. I can be truly proactive, value driven, because my \\nvalues are clear. \\nA Personal Mission Statement \\nThe most effective way I know to Begin with the End in Mind is to develop a personal mission \\nstatement or philosophy or creed. It focuses on  what you want to be (character) and to do \\n(contributions and achievements) and on the values  or principles upon which being and doing are \\nbased \\nBecause each individual is unique, a personal mission statement will reflect that uniqueness, both in \\ncontent and form. My friend, Rolfe Kerr, has expressed his personal creed in this way: \\n   Succeed at home first.  '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 50}, page_content=\"T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nSeek and merit divine help. \\n   Never compromise with honesty. \\n   Remember the people involved. \\nHear both sides before judging. \\n   Obtain counsel of others. \\n   Defend those who are absent. \\n   Be sincere yet decisive. \\nDevelop one new proficiency a year. \\n   Plan tomorrow's work today. \\n   Hustle while you wait. \\n   Maintain a positive attitude.  \\nKeep a sense of humor. \\nBe orderly in person and in work. \\nDo not fear mistakes -- fear on ly the absence of creative, constructive, and corrective responses to \\nthose mistakes. \\nFacilitate the success of subordinates. Listen twice as much as you speak. \\nConcentrate all abilities and efforts on the task at hand, not worrying about the next job or \\npromotion. \\nA woman seeking to balance family and work va lues has expressed her sense of personal mission \\ndifferently: \\nI will seek to balance career and family as best I can since both are important to me. \\nMy home will be a place where I and my family, friends, and guests find joy, comfort, peace, and \\nhappiness. Still I will seek to create a clean and or derly environment, yet livable and comfortable. I \\nwill exercise wisdom in what we choose to eat, read, see, and do at home. I especially want to teach my children to love, to learn, and to laugh -- and to work and develop their unique talents. \\n   I value the rights, freedoms, and responsibilities of our democratic society. I will be a concerned \\nand informed citizen, involved in the political proc ess to ensure my voice is  heard and my vote is \\ncounted. \\nI will be a self-starting individual who exercises initiative in accomplishing my life's goals. I will \\nact on situations and opportunitie s, rather than to be acted upon. \\nI will always try to keep myself free from addi ctive and destructive habits. I will develop habits \\nthat free me from old labels and limits and expand my capabilities and choices. \\nMy money will be my servant, not my master. I will seek financial independence over time. My \\nwants will be subject to my needs and my means. Except for long-term home and car loans, I will seek to keep myself free from consumer debt. I will spend less than I earn and regularly save or invest part \\nof my income. \\nMoreover, I will use what money and talents I ha ve to make life more en joyable for others through \\nservice and charitable giving. \\nYou could call a personal mission statement a personal constitution.  Like the United States \\nConstitution, it's fundamentally changeless. In over 200 years, there have been only 26 amendments, \\n10 of which were in the original Bill of Rights. \\n   The United States Constitution is the standard by which every law in the country is evaluated. It is \\nthe document the president agrees to defend and suppo rt when he takes the Oath of Allegiance. It is \\nthe criterion by which people are admitted into citize nship. It is the foundation and the center that \\nenables people to ride through such major traumas as the Civil War, Vietnam, or Watergate. It is the \\nwritten standard, the key criterion by which everything else is evaluated and directed. \\nThe Constitution has endured and serves its vi tal function today because it is based on correct \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 51}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nprinciples, on the self-evident truths contained in  the Declaration of Independ ence.  These principles \\nempower the Constitution with a timeless strength, even in the midst of social ambiguity and change. \\n\"Our peculiar security,\" said Thomas Jefferson, \"is in the possession of a written Constitution.\" \\nA personal mission statement based on correct pr inciples becomes the same kind of standard for an \\nindividual. It becomes a personal constitution, the basis for making major, life-directing decisions, the \\nbasis for making daily decisions in the midst of the circumstances and em otions that affect our lives. It \\nempowers individuals with the same timele ss strength in the midst of change. \\nPeople can\\'t live with change if there\\'s not a ch angeless core inside them. The key to the ability to \\nchange is a changeless sense of who you are , what you are about and what you value. \\nWith a mission statement, we can flow with chan ges. We don\\'t need prejudgments or prejudices. \\nWe don\\'t need to figure out everything else in life, to stereotype and categorize everything and \\neverybody in order to accommodate reality \\nOur personal environment is also changing at an ever-increasing pace. Such rapid change burns \\nout a large number of people who feel they can hardly handle it, can hardly cope with life. They \\nbecome reactive and essentially give up, hoping that the things that happen to them will be good. \\nBut it doesn\\'t have to be that way. In the Nazi death camps where Viktor Frankl learned the \\nprinciple of proactivity, he also learned the importan ce of purpose, of meaning in life. The essence of \\n\"logotherapy,\" the philosophy he later developed an d taught, is that many so-called mental and \\nemotional illnesses are really symptoms of an unde rlying sense of meaninglessness or emptiness. \\nLogotherapy eliminates that emptiness by helping th e individual to detect his unique meaning, his \\nmission in life. \\nOnce you have that sense of mission, you have the essence of your own proactivity. You have the \\nvision and the values which direct your life. Yo u have the basic direction from which you set your \\nlong- and short-term goals. You have the power of a written constitution based on correct principles, \\nagainst which every decision concerning the most effective use of your time, your talents, and your energies can be effectively measured. \\nAt the Center \\nIn order to write a personal mission statement, we must begin at the very center of our Circle of \\nInfluence, that center comprised of our most ba sic Our paradigms, the lens through which we see the \\nworld. \\nIt is here that we deal with our vision and ou r values. It is here that we use our endowment of \\nself-awareness to examine our maps and, if we value correct principles, to make certain that our maps \\naccurately describe the territory, that our paradigms are based on principles  and reality. It is here that \\nwe use our endowment of conscience as a compass to help us detect our own unique talents and areas \\nof contribution. It is here that we use our endowment of imagination to mentally create the end we \\ndesire, giving direction and purpose to our begi nnings and providing the substance of a written \\npersonal constitution. \\nIt is also here that our focused efforts achiev e the greatest results. As we work within the very \\ncenter of our Circle of Influence, we expand it .  This is highest-leverage PC work, significantly \\nimpacting the effectiveness of every aspect of our lives. \\nWhatever is at the center of our life will be th e source of our security, guidance, wisdom, and power. \\nSecurity represents your sense of worth, your identity, your emotional anchorage, your self-esteem, \\nyour basic personal strength or lack of it. \\nGuidance means your source of direction in life. Encompassed by your map, your internal frame of \\nreference that interprets for you what is happening out there, are standards or principles or implicit \\ncriteria that govern moment-by-moment decision-making and doing.

It embraces judgment, discernment, \\ncomprehension. It is a gestalt or oneness, an integrated wholeness. \\nPower is the faculty or capacity to act, the strength and potency to accomplish something. It is the \\nvital energy to make choices and decisions. It  also includes the capacity to overcome deeply \\nembedded habits and to cultivate higher, more effective ones. \\nThese four factors -- security, guidance, wisd om, and power -- are interdependent. Security and \\nclear guidance bring true wisdom, and wisdom beco mes the spark or catalyst to release and direct \\npower. When these four factors are present together, harmonized and enlivened by each other, they \\ncreate the great force of a noble personality, a ba lanced character, a beautifully integrated individual. \\nThese life-support factors also undergird every ot her dimension of life. And none of them is an \\nall-or-nothing matter. The degree to which you have  developed each one could be charted somewhere \\non a continuum, much like the Maturity Continuum de scribed earlier. At the bottom end, the four \\nfactors are weak. You are basically dependent on circumstances or other people, things over which \\nyou have no direct control. At the top end you are  in control. You have independent strength and \\nthe foundation for rich, inte rdependent relationships. \\nYour security lies somewhere on the continuum between extreme insecurity on one end, wherein \\nyour life is buffeted by all the fickle forces that play upon it, and a deep sense of high intrinsic worth \\nand personal security on the other end. Your guidance ranges on the continuum from dependence on \\nthe social mirror or other unstable, fluctuating sources to strong inne r direction. Your wisdom falls \\nsomewhere between a totally inaccurate map where ev erything is distorted and nothing seems to fit, \\nand a complete and accurate map of lif e wherein all the parts and principl es are properly related to each \\nother. Your power lies somewhere between immobilization or being a puppet pulled by someone \\nelse's strings to high proactivity, the power to act according to your own values instead of being acted \\nupon by other people and circumstances. \\nThe location of these factors on the continuum, the resulting degree of their integration, harmony, \\nand balance, and their positive impact on every aspect  of your life is a function of your center, the basic \\nparadigms at your very core. \\nAlternative Centers \\nEach of us has a center, though we usually don't recognize it as such. Neither do we recognize the \\nall-encompassing effects of that center on every aspect of our lives. \\nLet's briefly examine several centers or co re paradigms people typically have for a better \\nunderstanding of how they affect these four fundame ntal dimensions and, ultimately, the sum of life \\nthat flows from them. \\n   Spouse Centeredness.  Marriage can be the most  intimate, the most satisf ying, the most enduring, \\ngrowth-producing of human relationships. It might seem natural and proper to be centered on one's \\nhusband or wife. \\nBut experience and observation tell a different story. Over the years, I have been involved in \\nworking with many troubled marriages, and I have observed a certain thread weaving itself through \\nalmost every spouse-centered relationship I have encountered.  That thread is strong emotional \\ndependence. \\nIf our sense of emotional worth comes primarily from our marriage, then we become highly \\ndependent upon that relationship. We become vuln erable to the moods and feelings, the behavior and \\ntreatment of our spouse, or to any external event that may impinge on the relationship -- a new child, \\nin-laws, economic setbacks, social successes, and so forth. \\nWhen responsibilities increase and stresses come in the marriage, we tend to revert to the scripts we \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 53}, page_content=\"T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nwere given as we were growing up. But so does our spouse. And those scripts are usually different. \\nDifferent ways of handling financial, child-discipline, or in-law issues come to the surface.  When these \\ndeep-seated tendencies combine with the emotional dependency in the marriage, the spouse-centered \\nrelationship reveals all its vulnerability. \\nWhen we are dependent on the person with wh om we are in conflict, both need and conflict are \\ncompounded. Love-hate overreactions, fight-or -flight tendencies, withdrawal, aggressiveness, \\nbitterness, resentment, and cold comp etition are some of the usual results. When these occur, we tend \\nto fall even further back on background tendencies an d habits in an effort to justify and defend our own \\nbehavior and we attack our spouse's. \\n   I n e v i t a b l y, anytime we are too vulnerable we feel the need to protect ourselves fr om further wounds. \\nSo we resort to sarcasm, cutting humor, criticis m -- anything that will keep from exposing the \\ntenderness within. Each partner tends to wait on the initiative of the other for love, only to be disappointed but also confirmed as to the rightness of the accusations made. \\n   There is only phantom security in such a relationship when all appears to be going well. Guidance \\nis based on the emotion of the moment. Wisdom an d power are lost in the counterdependent negative \\ninteractions. \\n   Family Centeredness.  Another common center is the family. This, too, may seem to be natural and proper.  As an area of focus and deep invest ment, it provides great opportunities for deep \\nrelationships, for loving, for sharing, for much that makes life worthwhile. But as a center, it ironically \\ndestroys the very elements necessary to family success. \\nPeople who are family-centered get their sense of security or personal worth from the family \\ntradition and culture or the family reputation. Thus , they become vulnerable to any changes in that \\ntradition or culture and to any influenc es that would affect that reputation. \\nFamily-centered parents do not have the emotional freedom, the power, to raise their children with \\ntheir ultimate welfare truly in mind. If they derive their own security from the family, their need to be \\npopular with their children may override the importance of a long-ter m investment in their children's \\ngrowth and development. Or they may be focused on  the proper and correct behavior of the moment. \\nAny behavior that they consider improper threatens their security. They become upset, guided by the \\nemotions of the moment, spontaneously reacting to  the immediate concern rather than the long-term \\ngrowth and development of the child. They may ove rreact and punish out of bad temper. They tend \\nto love their children conditionally, making them  emotionally dependent or counterdependent and \\nrebellious. \\n   Money Centeredness.  Another logical and extr emely common center to people's lives is making \\nmoney. Economic security is basic to one's opport unity to do much in any other dimension. In a \\nhierarchy or continuum of needs, physical survival and financial security comes first. Other needs are \\nnot even activated until that basic need is satisfied, at least minimally. \\n   Most of us face economic worries.  Many fo rces in the wider culture can and do act upon our \\neconomic situation, causing or threatening such di sruption that we often expe rience concern and worry \\nthat may not always rise to the conscious surface. \\nSometimes there are apparently noble reasons give n for making money, such as the desire to take \\ncare of one's family. And these things are importan t. But to focus on money-making as a center will \\nbring about its own undoing. \\nConsider again the four life-support factors -- security, guidance, wisd om, and power. Suppose I \\nderive much of my security from my employment or from my income or net worth. Since many \\nfactors affect these economic foun dations, I become anxious and uneasy, protective and defensive, \\nabout anything that may affect th em. When my sense of personal worth comes from my net worth, I \\nam vulnerable to anything that w ill affect that net worth. But wo rk and money, per se, provide no \\nwisdom, no guidance, and only a limited degree of power and security. All it takes to show the \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 54}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nlimitations of a money center is a crisis in my life or in the life of a loved one. \\nMoney-centered people often put aside fam ily or other priorities, assuming everyone will \\nunderstand that economic demands come first. I know one father who was leaving with his children \\nfor a promised trip to the circus when a phone call came  for him to come to work instead.  He declined.  \\nWhen his wife suggested that perhaps he should have gone to work , he responded, \"The work will \\ncome again, but childhood won\\'t.\" For the rest of their lives his children rememb ered this little act of \\npriority setting, not only as an object lesson in their minds but as an expression of love in their hearts. \\n   Work Centeredness. Work-centered people may become \"workaholics,\" driving themselves to \\nproduce at the sacrifice of health, relationships,  and other important areas of their lives.  Their \\nfundamental identity comes from their work -- \"I\\'m a doctor,\" \"I \\'m a writer,\" \"I\\'m an actor.\" \\n   Because their identity and sens e of self-worth are wrapped up in their work, their security is \\nvulnerable to anything that happens to prevent them  from continuing in it.  Their guidance is a \\nfunction of the demands of the work . Their wisdom and power come in the limited areas of their work, \\nrendering them ineffective in other areas of life. \\nPossession Centeredness.  A driving force of many people is possessions -- not only tangible, \\nmaterial possessions such as fashionable clothes, home s, cars, boats, and jewelry, but also the intangible \\npossessions of fame, glory, or social prominence. Most of us are aware, th rough our own experience, \\nhow singularly flawed such a center is, simply because it can vanish rapidly and it is influenced by so \\nmany forces. \\nIf my sense of security lies in my reputation or in  the things I have, my life will be in a constant state \\nof threat and jeopardy that these po ssessions may be lost or stolen or devalued. If I\\'m in the presence \\nof someone of greater net worth or fame or status, I f eel inferior. If I\\'m in the presence of someone of \\nlesser net worth or fame or status, I feel superior. My sense of self-worth constantly fluctuates. \\ndon\\'t have any sense of constancy or anchorage or persistent selfhood. I am constantly trying to \\nprotect and insure my assets, properties, securities, position, or reputation. We have all heard stories \\nof people committing suicide after lo sing their fortunes in a significan t stock decline or their fame in a \\npolitical reversal. \\n   Pleasure Centeredness.  Another common center, cl osely allied with possession s, is that of fun and \\npleasure. We live in a world where instant gratific ation is available and encouraged. Television and \\nmovies are major influences in increasing people\\'s expectations. They graphically portray what other \\npeople have and can do in living the life of ease and \"fun.\" \\nBut while the glitter of pleasure-centered lifestyl es is graphically portrayed, the natural result of \\nsuch lifestyles -- the impact on the inner person, on productivity, on rela tionships -- is seldom \\naccurately seen. \\nInnocent pleasures in moderation can provide relaxation for the body and mind and can foster \\nfamily and other relationships. But pleasure, per se , offers no deep, lasting satisfaction or sense of \\nfulfillment. The pleasure-centered person, too s oon bored with each succeeding level of \"fun,\" \\nconstantly cries for more and more. So the next  new pleasure has to be bigger and better, more \\nexciting, with a bigger \"high.\" A person in this state becomes almost entirely narcissistic, interpreting all \\nof life in terms of the pleasure it provides to the self here and now. \\nToo many vacations that last too long, too many movies, too much TV, too much video game \\nplaying -- too much undisciplined leisure time in wh ich a person continually takes the course of least \\nresistance -- gradually wastes a life. It ensures th at a person\\'s capacities stay dormant, that talents \\nremain undeveloped, that the mind and spirit become lethargic and that the heart is unfulfilled. \\nWhere is the security, the guidance, the wisdom, an d the power? At the low en d of the continuum, in \\nthe pleasure of a fleeting moment. \\nMalcom Muggeridge writes \"A Twentieth-Century Testimony\": \\nWhen I look back on my life nowadays, which I sometimes do, what strikes me most forcibly about I '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 55}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nit is that what seemed at the time most signific ant and seductive, seems no w most futile and absurd. \\nFor instance, success in all of its various guises; be ing known and being praised; ostensible pleasures, \\nlike acquiring money or seducing women, or travelin g, going to and fro in the world and up and down \\nin it like Satan, explaining and experi encing whatever Vanity Fair has to offer. \\nIn retrospect, all these exercises in self-gratific ation seem pure fantasy, what Pascal called, \"licking \\nthe earth.\" \\nFriend/Enemy Centeredness.  Young people are particularly, though certainly not exclusively, \\nsusceptible to becoming friend-centered.  Acceptance and belonging to a peer group can become \\nalmost supremely important. The distorted and ev er-changing social mirror becomes the source for \\nthe four life-support factors, creating a high degree of dependence on the fluc tuating moods, feelings, \\nattitudes, and behavior of others. \\nFriend centeredness can also focus exclusively on  one person, taking on some of the dimensions of \\nmarriage. The emotional dependence on one indivi dual, the escalating need/conflict spiral, and the \\nresulting negative interactions can grow out of friend centeredness. \\n   And what about putting an enem y at the center of one\\'s life? Most  people would never think of it, \\nand probably no one would ever do it consciously.   Nevertheless, enemy ce ntering is very common, \\nparticularly when there is frequent interaction be tween people who are in real conflict.  When \\nsomeone feels he has been unjustly dealt with by an emotionally or socia lly significant person, it is very \\neasy for him to become preoccupied with the injustice and make the other person the center of his life. \\nRather than proactively leading his own life, the enem y-centered person is counterdependently reacting \\nto the behavior and attitudes of a perceived enemy. \\nOne friend of mine who taught at a university became very distraught because of the weaknesses of \\na particular administrator with whom he had a nega tive relationship. He allowed himself to think \\nabout the man constantly until eventually it became  a n  o b s e s s i o n .   I t  s o  p r e o c c u p i e d  h i m  t h a t  i t \\naffected the quality of his relationships with his family, his church, and his working associates. He \\nfinally came to the conclusion that he had to leav e the university and accept a teaching appointment \\nsomewhere else. \\n\"Wouldn\\'t you really prefer to teach at this university, if the man were not here?\" I asked him. \\n\"Yes, I would,\" he responded. \"But as long as  he is here, then my stay ing is too disruptive to \\neverything in life. I have to go. \\n\"Why have you made this administrator  the center of your life?\" I asked him. \\nHe was shocked by the question. He denied it. But I pointed out to him that he was allowing one \\nindividual and his weaknesses to distort his entire ma p of life, to undermine hi s faith and the quality of \\nhis relationships with his loved ones. \\nHe finally admitted that this individual had ha d such an impact on him, but he denied that he \\nhimself had made all these choices. He attributed  the responsibility for the unhappy situation to the \\nadministrator. He, himself, he declared, was not responsible. \\nAs we talked, little by little, he came to realiz e that he was indeed responsible, but that because he \\ndid not handle this responsibility well, he was being irresponsible. \\nMany divorced people fall into a similar pattern. They are still consumed with anger and bitterness \\nand self-justification regarding an ex-spouse. In  a negative sense, psychologically they are still \\nmarried -- they each need the weaknesses of the former partner to justify their accusations. \\nMany \"older\" children go through life either secr etly or openly hating th eir parents.  They blame \\nthem for past abuses, neglect, or favoritism and they  center their adult life on that hatred, living out the \\nreactive, justifying script that accompanies it. \\nThe individual who is friend- or enemy-centered has no intrinsic security. Feelings of self-worth \\nare volatile, a function of the emotional state or be havior of other people. Guidance comes from the \\nperson\\'s perception of how others will respond, and wisdom is limited  by the social lens or by an '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 56}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nenemy-centered paranoia.  The individual has no  power. Other people are pulling the strings. \\n   Church Centeredness.  I believe that almost an yone who is seriously involved in any church will \\nrecognize that churchgoing is not synonymous with personal spirituality. There are some people who \\nget so busy in church worship and projects that th ey become insensitive to the pressing human needs \\nthat surround them, contradicting the very precepts they profess to believe deeply. There are others \\nwho attend church less frequently or not at all bu t whose attitudes and behavior reflect a more genuine \\ncentering in the principles of the basic Judeo-Christian ethic. \\nHaving participated throughout my life in or ganized church and community service groups, I have \\nfound that attending church does not necessarily mean  living the principles taug ht in those meetings. \\nYou can be active in a church  but inactive in its gospel.\\n   In the church-centered  life, image or appearan ce can become a person\\'s dominant consideration, \\nleading to hypocrisy that undermines personal security and intrinsic worth. Guidance comes from a \\nsocial conscience, and the church-centered person tends to label ot hers artificially in terms of \"active,\" \\n\"inactive,\" \"liberal,\" \"orthodox,\" or \"conservative.\" \\nBecause the church is a formal organization made  up of policies, programs, practices, and people, it \\ncannot by itself give a person an y deep, permanent security or sense of intrinsic worth. Living the \\nprinciples taught by the church can do  this, but the organization alone cannot. \\nNor can the church give a person a constant sense of guidance. Church-centered people often tend \\nto live in compartments, acting and thinking and feel ing in certain ways on the Sabbath and in totally \\ndifferent ways on weekdays. Such a lack of wholen ess or unity or integrity is a further threat to \\nsecurity, creating the need for incr eased labeling and self-justifying. \\nSeeing the church as an end rather than as a means to an end undermines a person\\'s wisdom and \\nsense of balance. Although the ch urch claims to teach people about the source of power, it does not \\nclaim to be that power itself. It claims to be one vehicle through which divine power can be channeled \\ninto man\\'s nature. \\n   Self-Centeredness.  Perhaps the most common cent er today is the self. The most obvious form is \\nselfishness, which violates the values of most people . But if we look closely at many of the popular \\napproaches to growth and self-fulfillment, we often find self-centering at their core. \\nThere is little security, guidance, wisdom, or power  in the limited center of self. Like the Dead Sea \\nin Palestine, it accepts but never gives. It becomes stagnant. \\nOn the other hand, paying attention to the development of self in the greater perspective of \\nimproving one\\'s ability to serve, to produce, to contribute in meaningful ways, gives context for \\ndramatic increase in the four life-support factors \\nThese are some of the more common centers from  which people approach life. It is often much \\neasier to recognize the center in someone else\\'s life than to see it in your own. You probably know \\nsomeone who puts making money ahead of everyt hing else. You probably know someone whose \\nenergy is devoted to justifying his or her position in  an ongoing negative relationship. If you look, you \\ncan sometimes see beyond behavior into the center that creates it. \\nIdentifying Your Center \\nBut where do you stand? What is at the center of your own life? Sometimes that isn\\'t easy to see \\nPerhaps the best way to identify your own center is to look closely at your life-support factors. If \\nyou can identify with one or more of the description s below, you can trace it back to the center from \\nwhich it flows, a center which may be limiting your personal effectiveness. \\n   If you are Spouse Centered... \\n   S E C U R I T Y \\nYour feelings of security are based on the way your spouse treats you.

There is no consistent sense of direction, \\nno persistent wisdom, no steady power supply or sense of personal, intrinsic worth and identity. \\nThe ideal, of course, is to create one clear center from which you consistently derive a high degree of \\nsecurity, guidance, wisdom, and power, empowering your proactivity and giving congruency and \\nharmony to every part of your life. \\nA Principle Center \\nBy centering our lives on correct principles, we cr eate a solid foundation for development of the four \\nlife-support factors \\nOur security comes from knowing that, unlike ot her centers based on people or things which are \\nsubject to frequent and immediate change, correct principles do not change. We can depend on them '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 60}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t\\n   Principles don\\'t react to anything.  They won\\'t divorce us or run away with our best friend. They \\naren\\'t out to get us. They can\\'t pa ve our way with shortcuts and quic k fixes.  They don\\'t depend on \\nthe behavior of others, the environment, or the curre nt fad for their validity. Principles don\\'t die. \\nThey aren\\'t here one day and gone the next. They can\\'t be destroyed by fire, earthquake, or theft. \\nPrinciples are deep, fundamental truths, classic truths, generic common denominators. They are \\ntightly interwoven threads running with exactness, co nsistency, beauty, and strength through the fabric \\nof life. \\nEven in the midst of people or circumstances that  seem to ignore the principles, we can be secure in \\nthe knowledge that principles are bigger than people or circumstances, and that thousands of years of \\nhistory have seen them triumph, time and time agai n. Even more important, we can be secure in the \\nknowledge that we can validate them in our own lives, by our own experience. \\nAdmittedly, we\\'re not omniscient.  Our knowle dge and understanding of correct principles is \\nlimited by our own lack of awareness of our true nature and the world around us and by the flood of \\ntrendy philosophies and theories that are not in harmony with correct principles. These ideas will \\nhave their season of acceptance, but, like many befo re them, they won\\'t endure  because they\\'re built on \\nfalse foundations. \\nWe are limited, but we can push back the border s of our limitations. An understanding of the \\nprinciple of our own growth enable s us to search out correct principl es with the conf idence that the \\nmore we learn, the more clearly we can focus the lens  through which we see the world.  The principles \\ndon\\'t change; our understanding of them does. \\nThe wisdom and guidance that accompany Princi ple-Centered Living come from correct maps, from \\nthe way things really are, have be en, and will be. Correct maps enab le us to clearly see where we want \\nto go and how to get there. We can make our de cisions using the correct data that will make their \\nimplementation possible and meaningful. \\nThe personal power that comes from Principl e-Centered Living is the power of a self-aware, \\nknowledgeable, proactive individual, unrestricted by the attitudes, behaviors, and actions of others or \\nby many of the circumstances and environm ental influences that limit other people. \\nThe only real limitation of power is the natural consequences of the principles themselves. We are \\nfree to choose our actions, based on our knowledge of correct principles, but we are not free to choose \\nthe consequences of those actions. Remember, \"If yo u pick up one end of the stick, you pick up the \\nother. \\nPrinciples always have natural consequences a ttached to them. There are positive consequences \\nwhen we live in harmony with the principles. There are negative consequences when we ignore them. \\nBut because these principles apply to everyone, wh ether or not they are aware, this limitation is \\nuniversal. And the more we know of correct princi ples, the greater is our personal freedom to act \\nwisely. \\nBy centering our lives on timeless, unchanging  principles, we create a fundamental paradigm of \\neffective living. It is the center that  puts all other centers in perspective. \\nIf you are Principle Centered... \\n   S E C U R I T Y \\nYour security is based on correct principles that  do not change, regardless of  external conditions or \\ncircumstances. \\nYou know that true principles can repeatedly be validated in your own life, through your own \\nexperiences. \\nAs a measurement of self-improvement, correct principles function with exactness, consistency, \\nbeauty and strength. \\n   Correct principles help you understand your own development, endowing you with the confidence \\nto learn more, thereby increasing your knowledge and understanding.

A \\nparadigm is like a pair of glasses; it affects the wa y you see everything in your life.

You may tell the boss you can't stay and yo u take her to the concert in an effort to please \\nher. You may feel you have to stay to protect your job, but you'll do so grudgingly, anxious about her \\nresponse, trying to justify your decision and protect yourself from her disappointment or anger. \\nIf you're looking through a money-centered lens , your main thought will be of the overtime you'll \\nget or the influence working late will have on a potential raise. You may call your wife and simply tell \\nher you have to stay, assuming she'll unders tand that economic demands come first. \\nIf you're work-centered, you may be thinking of the opportunity.

You may give yourself a pat on the \\nback for putting hours well beyond what is required, evidence of what a hard worker you are. Your \\nwife should be proud of you! \\nIf you\\'re possession-centered, you might be thinki ng of the things the overtime income could buy. \\nOr you might consider what an asset to your reputa tion at the office it would be if you stayed.  \\nEveryone would hear tomorrow how noble, how sacrificing and dedicated you are. \\nIf you\\'re pleasure-centered, you\\'ll probably can th e work and go to the conc ert, even if your wife \\nwould be happy for you to work late. You deserve a night out! \\nIf you\\'re friend-centered, your decision woul d be influenced by whether or not you had invited \\nfriends to attend the concert with you. Or whether your friends at work were going to stay late, too. \\nIf you\\'re enemy-centered, you may stay late because you know it will give you a big edge over that \\nperson in the office who thinks he \\'s the company\\'s greatest asset. While he\\'s off having fun, you\\'ll be \\nworking and slaving, doing his work and yours, sacrificing your person al pleasure for the good of the \\ncompany he can so blithely ignore. \\nIf you\\'re church-centered, you might be influenc ed by plans other church members have to attend \\nthe concert, by whether or not any church members work at your office, or by the nature of the concert \\n-- Handel\\'s Messiah might rate higher in priority than  a rock concert. Your decision might also be \\naffected by what you think a \"goo d church member\" would do and by  whether you view the extra work \\nas \"service\" or \"seeking after material wealth.\" \\nIf you\\'re self-centered, you\\'ll be focused on what  will do you the most good. Would it be better for \\nyou to go out for the evening? Or would it be better for you to make a few points with the boss? How \\nthe different options affect you will be your main concern. \\nAs we consider various ways of looking at a si ngle event, is it any wonder that we have \"young \\nlady/old lady\" perception problems in our in teractions with each other? Can you see how \\nfundamentally our centers affect us? Right down to our motivations, our daily decisions, our actions (or, \\nin too many cases, our reactions), our interpretati ons of events? That\\'s wh y understanding your own \\ncenter is so important. And if that center does  not empower you as a proactive person, it becomes \\nfundamental to your effectiveness to make the necessa ry Paradigm Shifts to create a center that will. \\nAs a principle-centered person, you try to stand apart from the emotion of the situation and from \\nother factors that would act on you, and evaluate the option. Looking at the balanced whole -- the \\nwork needs, the family needs, ot her needs that may be involved an d the possible implications of the \\nvarious alternative decisions -- you\\'ll try to come up  with the best solution, taking all factors into \\nconsideration. \\nWhether you go to the concert or stay and work is  really a small part of an effective decision. You \\nmight make the same choice with a number of other centers.  But there are several important \\ndifferences when you are coming from a principle-centered paradigm. First, you are not being acted \\nupon by other people or circumstances. You are proactively choosing what you determine to be the \\nbest alternative. You make your decisions consciously and knowledgeably. \\nSecond, you know your decision is most effectiv e because it is based on pr inciples with predictable \\nlong-term results. \\nThird, what you choose to do contributes to your ultimate values in life. Staying at work to get the \\nedge on someone at the office is an entirely diffe rent evening in your life from staying because you \\nvalue your boss\\'s effectiveness and you genuinely wa nt to contribute to the company\\'s welfare. The \\nexperiences you have as you carry out your decision s take on quality and meaning in the context of \\nyour life as a whole. \\nFourth, you can communicate to your wife and your boss within strong networks you\\'ve created in \\nyour interdependent relationships. Because you are independent, you can be effectively \\ninterdependent. You might decide to delegate what is delegable and come in early the next morning '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 63}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nto do the rest. \\nAnd finally, you\\'ll feel comfortable about your decision.  Whatever you ch oose to do, you can focus \\non it and enjoy it. \\nAs a principle-centered person, you see things differently. And because you see things differently, \\nyou think differently, you act differently. Becaus e you have a high degree of security, guidance, \\nwisdom, and power that flows from a solid, unchanging core, you have the foundation of a highly \\nproactive and highly effective life. \\nWriting and Using a A Personal Mission Statement \\n   As we go deeply within oursel ves, as we understand and realign our basic paradigms to bring them \\nin harmony with correct principles, we create both an effective, empowering center and a clear lens \\nthrough which we can see the world. We can then fo cus that lens on how we, as unique individuals, \\nrelate to that world \\n   Frankl says we detect rather than  invent our missions in life. I lik e that choice of words. I think \\neach of us has an internal monitor or sense, a conscience, that gives us an awareness of our own \\nuniqueness and the singular contri butions that we can make. In F rankl\\'s words, \"Everyone has his \\nown specific vocation or mission in life. Therein he cannot be replaced, nor can his life be repeated. \\nThus, everyone\\'s task is as unique as is  his specific opportunity to implement it. \\nIn seeking to give verbal expression to that  uniqueness, we are again reminded of the fundamental \\nimportance of proactivity and of working within ou r Circle of Influence.  To seek some abstract \\nmeaning to our lives out in our Circle of Concern is to abdicate our proactive responsibility, to place our \\nown first creation in the hands of circumstance and other people. \\n   Our meaning comes from within.  Again, in th e words of Frankl, \"Ultimately, man should not ask \\nwhat the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each \\nman is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for hi s own life; to life he can \\nonly respond by being responsible.\" \\nPersonal responsibility, or proactivity, is fun damental to the first creation.  Returning to the \\ncomputer metaphor, Habit 1 says \"You are the prog rammer.\" Habit 2, then, says, \"Write the program.\" \\nUntil you accept the idea that you are responsible, that you are the programmer, you won\\'t really invest \\nin writing the program. \\nAs proactive people , we can begin to give expression to what we want to be and to do in our lives. \\nWe can write a personal mission st atement, a personal constitution. \\nA mission statement is not so mething you write overnight. It takes deep introspection, careful \\nanalysis, thoughtful expression, and often many rewrit es to produce it in final form. It may take you \\nseveral weeks or even months before you feel really co mfortable with it, before you feel it is a complete \\nand concise expression of your innermost values and directions. Even then, you will want to review it \\nregularly and make minor changes as the years bring additional insights or changing circumstances. \\nBut fundamentally, your mission statement becomes your constitution, the solid expression of your \\nvision and values. It becomes the criterion by which you measure everything else in your life. \\nI recently finished reviewing my own mission stat ement, which I do fairly regularly. Sitting on the \\nedge of a beach, alone, at the end of a bicycle ride, I took out my organizer and hammered it out. It took several hours, but I felt a sense of clarity, a sense of organization and commitment, a sense of \\nexhilaration and freedom. \\nI find the process is as important as the produc t.  Writing or reviewing a mission statement changes \\nyou because it forces you to think through your prio rities deeply, carefully, an d to align your behavior \\nwith your beliefs. As you do, other people begin to sense that you\\'re not being driven by everything \\nthat happens to you. You have a sense of mission about what you\\'re trying to do and you are excited '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 64}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nabout it. \\nUsing Your Whole Brain \\nOur self-awareness empowers us to examine ou r own thoughts. This is particularly helpful in \\ncreating a personal mission statement because the two unique human endowments that enable us to \\npractice Habit 2 -- imagination and conscience -- are pr imarily functions of the right side of the brain. \\nUnderstanding how to tap into that right brain capa city greatly increases our first-creation ability. \\nA great deal of research has been conducted for decades on what has come to be called brain \\ndominance theory. The findings basically indicated th at each hemisphere of the brain -- left and right \\n-- tends to specialize in and preside over different fun ctions, process different kinds of information, and \\ndeal with different kinds of problems. \\nEssentially, the left hemisphere is the more logical/verbal one and the right hemisphere the more \\nintuitive, creative one. The left deals with word s, the right with pictures; the left with parts and \\nspecifics, the right with wholes and the relationship  between the parts. The left deals with analysis, \\nwhich means to break apart; the right with synthesis, which means to pu t together. The left deals with \\nsequential thinking; the right with simultaneous and holistic thinking. The left is time bound; the right \\nis time free. \\n   Although people use both sides of the brain, one side or the other generally tends to be dominant in \\neach individual. Of course, the ideal would be to cultivate and develop the ability to have good \\ncrossover between both sides of the brain so that a person could first sense wh at the situation called for \\nand then use the appropriate tool to deal with it. Bu t people tend to stay in the \"comfort zone\" of their \\ndominant hemisphere and process every situation accord ing to either a right- or left-brain preference. \\n   In the words of Abraham Masl ow, \"He that is good with a hamme r tends to think everything is a \\nnail.\" This is another factor that affects the \"young  lady/old lady\" perception difference. Right-brain \\nand left-brain people tend to look  at things in different ways. \\nWe live in a primarily left-brain-dominant world, where words and measurement and logic are \\nenthroned, and the more creative, intuitive, sensing, ar tistic aspect of our nature is often subordinated. \\nMany of us find it more difficult to tap into our right-brain capacity. \\nAdmittedly this description is oversimplified and new studies will undoubtedly throw more light \\non brain functioning. But the point here is that we are capable of performing many different kinds of \\nthought processes and we barely tap ou r potential. As we become aware of its different capacities, we \\ncan consciously use our minds to meet sp ecific needs in more effective ways. \\nTwo Ways to Tap the Right Brain \\nIf we use the brain dominance theory as a model,  it becomes evident that the quality of our first \\ncreation is significantly impacted by our ability to use our creative right brain. The more we are able \\nto draw upon our right-brain capacity, the more fully we will be able to visua lize, to synthesize, to \\ntranscend time and present circumstances, to project a holistic picture of what we want to do and to be \\nin life. \\nExpand Perspective \\nSometimes we are knocked out of our left-brain environment and thought pa tterns and into the right \\nbrain by an unplanned experience. The death of a loved one, a severe illness, a financial setback, or extreme adversity can cause us to stand back, look at our lives, and ask ourselves some hard questions: '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 65}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\n\"What\\'s really important? Why am I doing what I\\'m doing? \\nBut if you\\'re proactive, you don\\'t have to wa it for circumstances or other people to create \\nperspective-expanding experiences. You can consciously create your own. \\nThere are a number of ways to do this. Thro ugh the powers of your imagination, you can visualize \\nyour own funeral, as we did at the beginning of this  chapter. Write your own eulogy. Actually write \\nit out.  Be specific. \\nYou can visualize your twenty-fifth and then your  fiftieth wedding anniversary. Have your spouse \\nvisualize this with you. Try to capture the essence of the family relationship you want to have created \\nthrough your day-by-day investment over a period of that many years. \\nYou can visualize your retirement from your  present occupation.  What contributions, what \\nachievements will you want to have made in your field? What plans will you have after retirement? \\nWill you enter a second career? \\n   Expand your mind.  Visualize in rich detail.  Involve as many emotions an d feelings as possible. \\nInvolve as many of the senses as you can. \\nI have done similar visualization exercises with some of my university classes. \"Assume you only \\nhave this one semester to live,\" I tell my students, \"a n d  t h a t  d u r i n g  t h i s  s e m e s t e r  y o u  a r e  t o  s t a y  i n \\nschool as a good student. Visualiz e how you would spend your semester. \\nThings are suddenly placed in a different perspe ctive. Values quickly surface that before weren\\'t \\neven recognized. \\nI have also asked students to live with that expanded perspective for a week and keep a diary of \\ntheir experiences. \\nThe results are very revealing. They start writing to parents to tell them how much they love and \\nappreciate them. They reconcile with a brothe r, a sister, a friend where the relationship has \\ndeteriorated. \\nThe dominant, central theme of their activities, the underlying principle, is love. The futility of \\nbad-mouthing, bad thinking, put-downs, and accusa tion becomes very evident when they think in \\nterms of having only a short time to live. Princi ples and values become more evident to everybody. \\nThere are a number of techniques using your imagination that can put you in touch with your \\nvalues. But the net effect of every one I have ever used is the same. When people seriously \\nundertake to identify what really matters most to them in their lives, what they really want to be and to \\ndo, they become very reverent. They start to think in larger terms than today and tomorrow. \\nVisualization and Affirmation \\nPersonal leadership is not a singular experience . It doesn\\'t begin and end with the writing of a \\npersonal mission statement. It is, rather, the ongoing process of keeping your vision and values before \\nyou and aligning your life to be congruent with thos e most important things. And in that effort, your \\npowerful right-brain capacity can be a great help to yo u on a daily basis as you work to integrate your \\npersonal mission statement into your life. It\\'s an other application of \"Begin with the End in Mind.\" \\nLet\\'s go back to an example we mentioned before. Suppose I am a parent who really deeply loves \\nm y  c h i l d r e n .   S u p p o s e  I  i d e n t i f y  t h a t  a s  o n e  o f  m y  f u n d a m e n t a l  v a l u e s  i n  m y  p e r s o n a l  m i s s i o n statement. But suppose, on a daily basis, I have trouble overreacting. \\nI can use my right-brain power of visualization to write an \"affirmation\" that will help me become \\nmore congruent with my deeper values in my daily life. \\nA good affirmation has five basic ingredients: it\\'s personal, it\\'s positive, it\\'s present tense, it\\'s visual, \\nand it\\'s emotional. So I might write something like  this: \"It is deeply sati sfying (emotional) that I \\n(personal) respond (present tense) with wisdom, lo ve, firmness, and self-control (positive) when my \\nchildren misbehave.\" '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 66}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nThen I can visualize it. I can spend a few minu tes each day and totally relax my mind and body. I \\ncan think about situations in which my children might misbehave. I can visualize them in rich detail. \\nI can feel the texture of the chair I might be sitting on, the floor under my feet , the sweater I\\'m wearing. \\nI can see the dress my daughter has on, the expression  on her face. The more clearly and vividly I can \\nimagine the detail, the more deeply I will experience it, the less I will see it as a spectator. \\nThen I can see her do something very specific which normally makes my heart pound and my \\ntemper start to flare. But instead of seeing my no rmal response, I can see myself handle the situation \\nwith all the love, the power, the self-control I have  c a p t u r e d  i n  m y  a f f i r m a t i o n .   I  c a n  w r i t e  t h e \\nprogram, write the script, in ha rmony with my values, with my  personal mission statement. \\nAnd if I do this, day after day my behavior will change. Instead of living out of the scripts given to \\nme by my own parents or by society or by genetics or my environment, I will be living out of the script I \\nhave written from my own self-selected value system. \\nI have helped and encouraged my son, Sean, to  use this affirmation process extensively throughout \\nhis football career. We started when he played qu arterback in high school, and eventually, I taught \\nhim how to do it on his own. \\nWe would try to get him in a very relaxed st ate of mind through deep breathing and progressive \\nmuscle relaxation technique so that he became very  quiet inside. Then I would help him visualize \\nhimself right in the heat of the toughest situations imaginable. \\nHe would imagine a big blitz coming at him fast. He had to read the blitz and respond. He \\nwould imagine giving audibles at the line after read ing defenses. He would imagine quick reads with \\nhis first receiver, his second receiver, his third receiver. He would imagine options that he normally \\nwouldn\\'t do. \\nAt one point in his football career, he told me he was constantly getting uptight. As we talked, I \\nrealized that he was visualizing uptightness. So we worked on visualizing relaxation in the middle of \\nthe big pressure circumstance. We discovered that th e nature of the visualizat ion is very important. \\nIf you visualize the wrong thing, you\\'ll produce the wrong thing.\\n   Dr. Charles Garfield has done extensive researc h on peak performers, both in athletics and in \\nbusiness. He became fascinated with peak pe rformance in his work with the NASA program, \\nwatching the astronauts rehearse everything on e arth again and again in a simulated environment \\nbefore they went to space. Although he had a doctor ate in mathematics, he decided to go back and get \\nanother Ph.D. in the field of psychology and study the characteristics of peak performers. \\nOne of the main things his research showed was th at almost all of the worl d-class athletes and other \\npeak performers are visualizers. They see it; they feel  it; they experience it before they actually do it. \\nThey Begin with the End in Mind. \\nYou can do it in every area of your life. Be fore a performance, a sales presentation, a difficult \\nconfrontation, or the daily challenge of meeting a goal, see it clearly, vividly, re lentlessly, over and over \\nagain. Create an internal \"comfort zone.\" Then, when  you get into the situation, it isn\\'t foreign. It \\ndoesn\\'t scare you. \\nYour creative, visual right brain is one of your most important assets, both in creating your personal \\nmission statement and in integrating it into your life. \\nThere is an entire body of literature and audio and video tapes that deals with this process of \\nvisualization and affirmation. Some of the more recent developments in this field include such things as subliminal programming, neurolinguistic program ming, and new forms of relaxation and self-talk \\nprocesses. These all involve explanation, elabo ration, and different packaging of the fundamental \\nprinciples of the first creation. \\nMy review of the success literature brought me in contact with hundreds of books on this subject. \\nAlthough some made extravagant claims and relied on  anecdotal rather than sci entific evidence, I think \\nthat most of the material is fundamentally sound. The majority of it appears to have originally come '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 67}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nout of the study of the Bible by many individuals. \\nIn effective personal leadership, visualization and affirmation techniques emerge naturally out of a \\nfoundation of well thought through purposes and princi ples that become the center of a person\\'s life. \\nThey are extremely powerful in rescripting and reprogramming, into writing deeply committed-to \\npurposes and principles into one\\'s heart and mind. I believe that central to all enduring religions in \\nsociety are the same principles and practices clot hed in different language  -- meditation, prayer, \\ncovenants, ordinances, scripture study, empathy, co mpassion, and many differ ent forms of the use of \\nboth conscience and imagination. \\nBut if these techniques become part of the pers onality ethic and are severe d from a base of character \\nand principles, they can be misused and abused in serving other centers, primarily the self center. \\nAffirmation and visualization are forms of pr ogramming, and we must be certain that we do not \\nsubmit ourselves to any programming that is not in harmony with our basic center or that comes from \\nsources centered on money-making, self interest , or anything other than correct principles. \\nThe imagination can be used to achieve the fleet ing success that comes when a person is focused on \\nmaterial gain or on \"what\\'s in it for me.\" But I belie ve the higher use of imagin ation is in harmony with \\nthe use of conscience to transcend self and create a life of contribution based on unique purpose and on \\nthe principles that govern interdependent reality. \\nIdentifying Roles and Goals \\nOf course, the logical/verbal left brain become s important also as you attempt to capture your \\nright-brain images, feelings, and pictures in the words of a written mission statement.  Just as \\nbreathing exercises help integrate body and mind, wr iting is a kind of psycho-neural muscular activity \\nwhich helps bridge and integrate the conscious and subconscious minds. Writing distills, crystallizes, \\nand clarifies thought and helps break the whole into parts. \\nWe each have a number of different roles in ou r lives -- different areas or capacities in which we \\nhave responsibility. I may, for example, have a role as an individual, a husband, a father, a teacher, a \\nchurch member, and a businessman. And each of these roles is important. \\nOne of the major problems that arises when people work to become more effective in life is that they \\ndon\\'t think broadly enough.  They lose the sense of proportion, the balance, the natural ecology necessary to effective living. They may get consum ed by work and neglect personal health. In the \\nname of professional success, they may neglect th e most precious relationships in their lives. \\nYou may find that your mission statement will be much more balanced, much easier to work with, if \\nyou break it down into the specific role areas of yo ur life and the goals you wa nt to accomplish in each \\narea. Look at your professional role. You might be a salesperson, or a manager, or a product \\ndeveloper. What are you about in th at area? What are the values that should guide you? Think of your \\npersonal roles -- husband, wife, father, mother, neighbor, friend. What are you about in those roles? \\nWhat\\'s important to you? Think of community role s -- the political area, public service, volunteer \\norganizations. \\nOne executive has used the idea of roles and goals to create the follo wing mission statement: \\nMy mission is to live with integrity an d to make a difference in the lives of others. \\n   To fulfill this mission: \\nI have charity: I seek out and love the one -- each one -- regardless of his situation. \\nI sacrifice: I devote my time, talents, and resources to my mission. \\nI inspire: I teach by example that we are all children of a loving  Heavenly Father and that every \\nGoliath can be overcome. \\nI am impactful: What I do makes a difference in the lives of others. \\nThese roles take priority in achieving my mission: '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 68}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nHusband -- my partner is the most important pers on in my life. Together we contribute the fruits \\nof harmony, industry, charity, and thrift. \\nFather -- I help my children experience progressively greater joy in their lives. \\nSon/Brother -- I am frequently \"there\" for support and love. \\nChristian -- God can count on me to keep my covenants and to serve his other children. \\nNeighbor -- The love of Christ is visible through my actions toward others. \\nChange Agent -- I am a catalyst for developing high performance in large organizations. \\nScholar -- I learn important new things every day. \\nWriting your mission in terms of the important roles in your life gives yo u balance and harmony. \\nIt keeps each role clearly before you. You can revi ew your roles frequently to make sure that you don\\'t \\nget totally absorbed by one role to the exclusion of others that are equally or even more important in \\nyour life. \\nAfter you identify your various roles, then you can think about the Long Term Goals are plans you \\nmake that support the principles described in your  Mission Statement. These goals should represent \\nareas you want to focus on in the near future. Typi cally, Long Term Goals take  longer than a week to \\ncomplete, but are most specific than the lifetime goals of your Mission Statement.long-term goals you \\nwant to accomplish in each of those roles. We\\'r e into the right brain ag ain, using imagination, \\ncreativity, conscience, and inspiratio n. If these goals are the extensio n of a mission statement based on \\ncorrect principles, they will be vitally different from the goals people normally set. They will be in harmony with correct principles, with natural laws , which gives you greater power to achieve them. \\nThey are not someone else\\'s goals yo u have absorbed. They are your go als. They reflect your deepest \\nvalues, your unique talent, your sense of mission. And they grow out of your chosen roles in life. \\nAn effective goal focuses primarily on results rat her than activity. It identifies where you want to \\nbe, and, in the process, helps you determine wher e you are. It gives you important information on \\nhow to get there, and it tells you when you have arrive d. It unifies your efforts and energy. It gives \\nmeaning and purpose to all you do. And it can finally translate itself into daily  activities so that you \\nare proactive, you are in charge of your life, you are  making happen each day the things that will enable \\nyou to fulfill your personal mission statement. \\nRoles and goals give structure and organized dire ction to your personal mi ssion. If you don\\'t yet \\nhave a personal mission statement, it\\'s a good place to begin.  Just identifying the various areas of your \\nlife and the two or three important results you feel you should accomplish in each area to move ahead \\ngives you an overall perspective of your life and a sense of direction. \\nAs we move into Habit 3, we\\'ll go into greater de pth in the area of short-term goals. The important \\napplication at this point is to iden tify roles and long-term goals as they  relate to your personal mission \\nstatement. These roles and long-term goals will prov ide the foundation for effective goal setting and \\nachieving when we get to the Habit 3 day-to-day management of life and time. \\nFamily Mission Statements \\nBecause Habit 2 is based on principle, it has broa d application. In addition to individuals, families, \\nservice groups, and organizations of all kinds become significantly more effective as they Begin with the \\nEnd in Mind. \\nMany families are managed on the basis of crises , moods, quick fixes, and instant gratification -- not \\non sound principles. Symptoms surface whenever st ress and pressure mount: people become cynical, \\ncritical, or silent or they start yelling and overre acting. Children who observe these kinds of behavior \\ngrow up thinking the only way to solve problems is flight or fight. \\nThe core of any family is what is changeless, what is always going to be there -- shared vision and \\nvalues. By writing a family mission statement,  you give expression to its true foundation. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 69}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nThis mission statement becomes its constituti on, the standard, the crit erion for evaluation and \\ndecision making. It gives continuity and unity to th e family as well as direction. When individual \\nvalues are harmonized with those of the family, members work togeth er for common purposes that are \\ndeeply felt. \\nAgain, the process is as important as the prod uct. The very process of writing and refining a \\nmission statement becomes a key way to improve the family. Working together to create a mission \\nstatement builds the PC capacity to live it. \\nBy getting input from every family member, draf ting a statement, getting feedback, revising it, and \\nusing wording from different family members, you get the family talking, communicating, on things \\nthat really matter deeply. The best mission stat ements are the result of family members coming \\ntogether in a spirit of mutual re spect, expressing their different vi ews, and working together to create \\nsomething greater than any one indi vidual could do alone. Periodic review to expand perspective, \\nshift emphasis or direction, amend or give new meaning to time-worn phrases can keep the family \\nunited in common values and purposes. \\nThe mission statement becomes the framework fo r thinking, for governing the family. When the \\nproblems and crises come, the constitution is there to remind family members of the things that matter \\nmost and to provide direction for problem solving and decision making based on correct principles. \\nIn our home, we put our mission statement up on a wall in the family room so that we can look at it \\nand monitor ourselves daily. When we read the phrases about the sounds of love in our home, order, responsible independence, cooperation, helpfulness,  meeting needs, develo ping talents, showing \\ninterest in each other\\'s talents, and giving service to  others it gives us some criteria to know how we\\'re \\ndoing in the things that matter most to us as a family. \\nWhen we plan our family goals and activities, we sa y, \"In light of these prin ciples, what are the goals \\nwe\\'re going to work on? What are our action plans to accomplish our goals and actualize these values?\" \\nWe review the statement frequently and rework  goals and jobs twice a year, in September and June \\n-- the beginning of school and the end of school -- to reflect the situation as it is, to improve it, to \\nstrengthen it. It renews us, it recommits us to what we believe in, what we stand for. \\nOrganizational Mission Statements \\nMission statements are also vital to successful organizations. One of the most important thrusts of \\nmy work with organizations is to assist them in developing effective mission statements. And to be \\neffective, that statement has to come from within  the bowels of the organization. Everyone should \\nparticipate in a meaningful way -- not just the top strategy planners, but everyone. Once again, the \\ninvolvement process is as important as the written product and is the key to its use. \\nI am always intrigued whenever I go to IBM and watch the training process there. Time and time \\nagain, I see the leadership of the organization come  into a group and say that IBM stands for three \\nthings: the dignity of the indivi dual, excellence, and service. \\nThese things represent the belief system of IBM. Everything else will change, but these three things \\nwill not change. Almost like osmosis, this belief syst em has spread throughout the entire organization, \\nproviding a tremendous base of shared values and personal security for everyone who works there. \\nOnce I was training a group of people for IBM in New York. It was small group, about 20 people, \\nand one of them became ill. He called his wife in  California, who expressed concern because his illness \\nrequired a special treatment. The IBM people resp onsible for the training session arranged to have \\nhim taken to an excellent hospital with medical specialists in the disease. But they could sense that his \\nwife was uncertain and really wanted him home where their personal physician could handle the \\nproblem. \\n   So they decided to get him home.  Concerned ab out the time involved in driving him to the airport '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 70}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nand waiting for a commercial plane, they brought in a helicopter, flew him to the airport, and hired a \\nspecial plane just to take this man to California. \\nI don\\'t know what costs that involved; my gu ess would be many thousands of dollars. But IBM \\nbelieves in the dignity of the indivi dual. That\\'s what the company stands for. To those present, that \\nexperience represented its belief system and was no surprise. I was impressed. \\nAt another time, I was scheduled to train 175 sho pping center managers at a particular hotel. I was \\namazed at the level of service there.  It wasn\\'t a cosmetic thing.  It was evident at all levels, \\nspontaneously, without supervision. \\nI arrived quite late, checked in, and asked if room  service were available. The man at the desk said, \\n\"No, Mr. Covey, but if you\\'re interested, I could go back and get a sandwich or a salad or whatever \\nyou\\'d like that we have in the kitchen.\" His attitu de was one of total concern about my comfort and \\nwelfare. \"Would you like to see your convention room?\" he continued. \"Do you have everything you \\nneed? What can I do for you? I\\'m here to serve you.\" \\nThere was no supervisor there checking up. This man was sincere. \\nThe next day I was in the mi ddle of a presentation when I disco vered that I didn\\'t have all the \\ncolored markers I needed. So I went out into th e hall during the brief break and found a bellboy \\nrunning to another convention. \"I\\'ve got a problem,\" I said. \"I\\'m here training a group of managers \\nand I only have a short break. I need some more colored pens. \\nHe whipped around and almost came to attention. He glanced at my name tag and said, \"Mr. \\nCovey, I will solve your problem.\" \\nHe didn\\'t say, \"I don\\'t know where to go\" or \"we ll, go and check the front desk .\" He just took care of \\nit. And he made me feel like it was his privilege to do so. \\nLater, I was in the side lobby, looking at some of the art objects. Someone from the hotel came up \\nto me and said, \"Mr. Covey, would yo u like to see a book that describes the art objects in this hotel?\" \\nHow anticipatory! How service-oriented! \\nI next observed one of the employees high up on a ladder cleaning windows in the lobby. From his \\nvantage point he saw a woman having a little difficulty in the garden with a walk er.  She hadn\\'t really \\nfallen, and she was with other people. But he cl imbed down that ladder, went outside, helped the \\nwoman into the lobby and saw that she was properly taken care of. Then he went back and finished cleaning the windows. \\nI wanted to find out how this organization had cr eated a culture where people bought so deeply into \\nthe value of customer service.  I interviewed housekeepers, waitre sses, bellboys in that hotel and \\nfound that this attitude had impregnated the mind s, hearts, and attitudes of every employee there. \\nI went through the back door into the kitche n, where I saw the central value: \"Uncompromising \\npersonalized service.\" I finally we nt to the manager and said, \"My business is helping organizations \\ndevelop a powerful team character, a team culture. I am amazed at what you have here.\" \\n\"Do you want to know the real key?\" he inquir ed. He pulled out the mission statement for the hotel \\nchain. \\nAfter reading it, I acknowledged, \"That\\'s an im pressive statement. But I know many companies \\nthat have impressive mission statements.\" \\n\"Do you want to see the one for this hotel?\" he asked. \\n\"Do you mean you developed one just for this hotel?\" \\n   \" Y e s . \" \\n\"Different from the one for the hotel chain?\" \\n\"Yes. It\\'s in harmony with that statement, but this one pertains to our situation, our environment, \\nour time.\" He handed me another paper. \\n\"Who developed this mission statement?\" I asked. \\n   \"Everybody,\" he replied. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 71}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t\\n   \"Everybody? Really, everybody?\" \\n   \" Y e s . \"\\n \"Housekeepers?\" \\n   \" Y e s . \"\\n \"Waitresses?\" \\n   \" Y e s . \"\\n   \"Desk clerks?\" \\n\"Yes. Do you want to see the mission statemen t written by the people who greeted you last night?\" \\nHe pulled out a mission statement that they, themselv es, had written that was interwoven with all the \\nother mission statements. Everyone, at every level, was involved. \\nThe mission statement for that hotel was the hub of a great wheel. It spawned the thoughtful, more \\nspecialized mission statements of particular groups of employees. It was used as the criterion for \\nevery decision that was made. It clarified what those people stood for -- how they related to the \\ncustomer, how they related to each other. It affect ed the style of the manage rs and the leaders. It \\naffected the compensation system. It affected the kind of people they recruited and how they trained \\nand developed them. Every aspect of  that organization, essentially, was a function of that hub, that \\nmission statement. \\nI later visited another hotel in the same chain, and the first thing I did when  I checked in was to ask \\nto see their mission statement, whic h they promptly gave me. At this  hotel, I came to understand the \\nmotto \"Uncompromising personalized service\" a little more. \\nFor a three-day period, I watched every conc eivable situation where service was called for. I \\nalways found that service was delivered in a very im pressive, excellent way. But it was always also \\nvery personalized. For instance, in the swimmi ng area I asked the attendant where the drinking \\nfountain was. He walked me to it. \\nBut the thing that impressed me the very most was to see an employee, on his own, admit a mistake \\nto his boss. We ordered room service, and were told  when it would be delivered to the room. On the \\nway to our room, the room service person spilled the hot chocolate, and it took  a few extra minutes to \\ngo back and change the linen on the tray and replace the drink. So the room service was about fifteen \\nminutes late, which was really not that important to us. \\nNevertheless, the next morning the room service manager phoned us to apologize and invited us to \\nhave either the buffet breakfast or a room service br eakfast, compliments of th e hotel, to in some way \\ncompensate for the inconvenience. \\nWhat does it say about the culture of an orga nization when an employee admits his own mistake, \\nunknown to anyone else, to the manager so that  customer or guest is better taken care of! \\nAs I told the manager of the first hotel I visite d, I know a lot of companies with impressive mission \\nstatements. But there is a real difference, all the difference in the world, in the effectiveness of a \\nmission statement created by everyone involved in the organization and one written by a few top \\nexecutives behind a mahogany wall. \\nOne of the fundamental problems in organizat ions, including families, is that people are not \\ncommitted to the determinations of other people fo r their lives. They simply don\\'t buy into them. \\nMany times as I work with organizations, I find  people whose goals are totally different from the \\ngoals of the enterprise. I commonly find reward systems completely out of alignment with stated \\nvalue systems. \\nWhen I begin work with companies that have al ready developed some kind of mission statement, I \\nask them, \"How many of the people here know that  you have a mission statement? How many of you \\nknow what it contains? How many were involved in cr eating it? How many really buy into it and use it \\nas your frame of reference in making decisions?\" \\nWithout involvement, there is no commitment. M ark it down, asterisk it, circle it, underline it. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 72}, page_content=\"T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nNo involvement, no commitment. \\nNow, in the early stages -- when a person is new to an organization or when a child in the family is \\nyoung -- you can pretty well give them a goal and they'll buy it, particularly if the relationship, \\norientation, and training are good. \\nBut when people become more mature and thei r own lives take on a separate meaning, they want \\ninvolvement, significant involvement. And if they don't have that involvement, they don't buy it. \\nThen you have a significant motivational problem whic h cannot be solved at the same level of thinking \\nthat created it. \\nThat's why creating an organizational mission st atement takes time, patience, involvement, skill, and \\nempathy. Again, it's not a quick fix. It takes time and sincerity, correct principles, and the courage \\nand integrity to align systems, structure, and manage ment style to the shared vision and values. But \\nit's based on correct principles and it works. \\n   An organizational mission statem ent -- one that truly reflects the deep shared vision and values of \\neveryone within that organization -- creates a great unity and tremendous commitment. It creates in people's hearts and minds a frame of reference, a set of criteria or gu idelines, by which they will govern \\nthemselves. They don't need someon e else directing, controlling, criticizing, or taking cheap shots. \\nThey have bought into the changeless co re of what the organization is about. \\nApplication Suggestions \\n1. Take the time to record the impressions you had in the funeral visualization at the beginning of \\nthis chapter. You may want to use the chart below to organize your thoughts. \\n2. Take a few moments and write down your ro les as you now see them. Are you satisfied with \\nthat mirror image of your life. \\n3. Set up time to completely separate yourself  from daily activities and to begin work on your \\npersonal mission statement. \\n4. Go through the chart in Appendix A showing different centers and circle all those you can \\nidentify with. Do they form a pattern for the be havior in your life? Are you comfortable with the \\nimplications of your analysis. \\n5. Start a collection of notes, quotes, and ideas you may want to use as reso urce material in writing \\nyour .personal mission statement. \\n6. Identify a project you will be facing in the near future and apply th e principles of mental \\ncreation. Write down the results you desire and what steps will lead to those results. \\n7. Share the principles of Habit 2 with your family or work group and suggest that together you \\nbegin the process of developing a fa mily or group mission statement. \\nHabit 3: Put First Things First TM -- Principles of Personal Managemen \\nThings which matter most must never be  at the mercy of thin gs which matter least \\n   - -G o e t h\\n *  * \\nWill you take just a moment and write down a short answer to the following two questions? Your \\nanswers will be important to you as you begin work on Habit 3. \\nQuestion 1: What one thing could you do (you aren't doing now) that if you did on a regular basis, \\nwould make a tremendous positive difference in your personal life? \\nQuestion 2: What one thing in your business or professional life would bring similar results? \\nWe'll come back to these answers later. But first, let's put Habit 3 in perspective \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 73}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nHabit 3 is the personal fruit, the practical fulfillment of Habits 1 and 2. \\nHabit 1 says, \"You\\'re the creator.  You are in charge.\"  It\\'s based on the four unique human \\nendowments of imagination, conscience, independ ent will, and particularly, self-awareness.  It \\nempowers you to say, \"That\\'s an u nhealthy program I\\'ve been given fr om my childhood, from my social \\nmirror. I don\\'t like that ineffective script. I can change.\" \\nHabit 2 is the first or mental creation. It\\'s ba sed on imagination -- the ability to envision, to see the \\npotential, to create with our minds what we canno t at present see without ey es; and conscience -- the \\nability to detect our own uniqueness and the person al, moral, and ethical guidelines within which we \\ncan most happily fulfill it. It\\'s the deep contact wi th our basic paradigms and values and the vision of \\nwhat we can become. \\nHabit 3, then, is the second creation -- the physical creation. It\\'s the fulfillment, the actualization, \\nthe natural emergence of Habits 1 and 2.  It\\'s the exercise of independ ent will toward becoming \\nprinciple-centered. It\\'s the day-in, day-out, moment-by-moment doing it. \\nHabits 1 and 2 are absolutely essential an d prerequisite to Habit 3.  You can\\'t become \\nprinciple-centered without first being aware of and developing your own proactive nature. You can\\'t \\nbecome principle-centered without first being aware of your paradigms and understanding how to shift \\nthem and align them with principl es. You can\\'t become principle-ce ntered without a vision of and a \\nfocus on the unique contribution that is yours to make. \\nBut with that foundation, you can beco me principle-centered, day-in and day-out, \\nmoment-by-moment, by living Habit 3 -- by practicing effective self-management. \\nManagement, remember, is clearly different from leadership.  Leadership is primarily a \\nhigh-powered, right-brain activity. It\\'s more of an art; it\\'s based on a philosophy. You have to ask \\nthe ultimate questions of life when you\\'re dealing with personal leadership issues. \\nBut once you have dealt with those issues, once you have resolved them, you then have to manage \\nyourself effectively to create a life congruent with  your answers. The ability to manage well doesn\\'t \\nmake much difference if you\\'re not even in the \"right  jungle.\" But if you are  in the right jungle, it \\nmakes all the difference. In fact, the ability to manage well determines the quality and even the \\nexistence of the second creation. Management is the breaking down, the anal ysis, the sequencing, the \\nspecific application, the time-bound left-brain aspect of effective self-government. My own maxim of \\npersonal effectiveness is this: Manage from the left; lead from the right. \\nThe Power of Independent Will \\nIn addition to self-awareness, imagination, an d conscience, it is the fo urth human endowment -- \\nindependent will -- that really makes effective self -management possible. It is the ability to make \\ndecisions and choices and to act in accordance with th em. It is the ability to act rather than to be acted \\nupon, to proactively carry out the program we have developed through the other three endowments. \\nThe human will is an amazing thing. Time afte r time, it has triumphed against unbelievable odds. \\nThe Helen Kellers of this world give dramatic eviden ce to the value, the power of the independent will. \\nBut as we examine this endowment in the context of effective self-management, we realize it\\'s \\nusually not the dramatic, the visible, the once-in-a-lifetime, up-by-the-bootstraps effort that brings \\nenduring success. Empowerment comes from the learning how to use this great endowment in the \\ndecisions we make every day. \\nThe degree to which we have developed our indepe ndent will in our everyday lives is measured by \\nour personal integrity. Integrity is, fundamentally, th e value we place on ourselves. It\\'s our ability to \\nmake and keep commitments to ourselves, to \"wal k our talk.\" It\\'s honor with self, a fundamental \\npart of the character ethic, the essence of proactive growth. \\nEffective management is putting first things firs t. While leadership decides what \"first things\" are, '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 74}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nit is management that puts them first, day-by-d ay, moment-by-moment. Management is discipline, \\ncarrying it out. \\nDiscipline derives from disciple -- disciple to a philo sophy, disciple to a set of principles, disciple to \\na set of values, disciple to an overriding purpose, to a superordinate goal or a person who represents \\nthat goal. \\nIn other words, if you are an effective manager of  your self, your discipline comes from within; it is a \\nfunction of your independent will. You are a discipl e, a follower, of your own deep values and their \\nsource. And you have the will, the integrity, to su bordinate your feelings, your impulses, your moods \\nto those values. \\nOne of my favorite essays is \"The Common Denominator of Success,\" written by E. M. Gray. He \\nspent his life searching for the one denominator that  all successful people share. He found it wasn\\'t \\nhard work, good luck, or astute human relations, th ough those were all importan t.  The one factor that \\nseemed to transcend all the rest embodies the essence of Habit 3: Putting First Things First. \\n\"The successful person has the habit of doing the things failures don\\'t like to do,\" he observed. \\n\"They don\\'t like doing them either necessarily. But th eir disliking is subordinated to the strength of \\ntheir purpose.\" \\nThat subordination requires a purpose, a missi on, a Habit 2 clear sense of direction and value, a \\nburning \"Yes!\" inside that makes it possible to say \"n o\" to other things. It also requires independent \\nwill, the power to do something when you don\\'t want to do it, to be a function of your values rather \\nthan a function of the impulse or desire of any give n moment. It\\'s the power to act with integrity to \\nyour proactive first creation. \\nFour Generations of Time Management \\nIn Habit 3 we are dealing with many of the questions addressed in the field of life and time \\nmanagement. As a longtime student of this fascina ting field, I am personally persuaded that the \\nessence of the best thinking in the area of time management can be captured in a single phrase: \\nOrganize and execute around priorities. That phrase represents the evolution of three generations of \\ntime-management theory, and how to best do it is  the focus of a wide v ariety of approaches and \\nmaterials. \\nPersonal management has evolved in a pattern similar to many other areas of human endeavor. \\nMajor developmental thrusts, or \"waves\" as Alvin To ffler calls them, follow each other in succession, \\neach adding a vital new dimension. For example, in  social development, the agricultural revolution \\nwas followed by the industrial revolution, which wa s followed by the informational revolution. Each \\nsucceeding wave created a surge of  social and personal progress. \\nLikewise, in the area of time management, each  generation builds on the one before it -- each one \\nmoves us toward greater control of our lives. The first wave or generation could be characterized by \\nnotes and checklists, an effort to give some semb lance of recognition and in clusiveness to the many \\ndemands placed on our time and energy. \\nThe second generation could be characterized by calendars and appointment books. This wave \\nreflects an attempt to look ahead, to sch edule events and activities in the future. \\nThe third generation reflects the current time-management field.  It adds to those preceding \\ngenerations the important idea of prioritization, of  clarifying values, and of comparing the relative \\nworth of activities based on their re lationship to those values. In addi tion, it focuses on setting goals -- \\nspecific long-, intermediate-, and short-term targ ets toward which time and energy would be directed \\nin harmony with values. It also includes the concept of daily planni ng, of making a specific plan to \\naccomplish those goals and activities de termined to be of greatest worth. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 75}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nWhile the third generation has made a significan t contribution, people have  begun to realize that \\n\"efficient\" scheduling and control of time are often counterproductive. The efficiency focus creates \\nexpectations that clash with the o pportunities to develop rich relationships, to meet human needs, and \\nto enjoy spontaneous moments on a daily basis. \\nAs a result, many people have become turned off by time management programs and planners that \\nmake them feel too scheduled, too restricted, and they \"throw the baby out with the bath water,\" \\nreverting to first- or second-generation techniques to  preserve relationships, to meet human needs, and \\nto enjoy spontaneous moments on a daily basis. \\nBut there is an emerging fourth generation that  is different in kind.  It recognizes that \"time \\nmanagement\" is really a misnomer -- the challenge is  not to manage time, but to manage ourselves. \\nSatisfaction is a function of expectation as well as realization. And expectation (and satisfaction) lie in \\nour Circle of Influence. \\nRather than focusing on things and time, four th-generation expectations focus on preserving and \\nenhancing relationships and accomplishing results -- in short, on maintaining the P/PC Balance. \\nQuadrant II \\nThe essential focus of the fourth generatio n of management can be captured in the Time \\nManagement Matrix diagrammed on the next page. Basically, we spend time in one of four ways. \\nAs you see, the two factors that define an ac tivity are urgent and important. Urgent means it \\nrequires immediate attention. It\\'s \"Now!\" Urgent th ings act on us. A ringing phone is urgent. Most \\npeople can\\'t stand the thought of just allowing th e phone to ring. You could spend hours preparing \\nmaterials, you could get all dressed up and travel to a person\\'s office to discuss a particular issue, but if \\nthe phone were to ring while you were there, it woul d generally take precedence over your personal \\nvisit. \\nIf you were to phone someone, there aren\\'t ma ny people who would say, \"I\\'ll get to you in 15 \\nminutes; just hold.\" But those same people would probably let you wait in an office for at least that \\nlong while they completed a telephon e conversation with someone else. \\n   Urgent matters are usually visible.  They press on us; they insist on acti on.  They\\'re often popular \\nwith others. They\\'re usually right in  front of us. And often they are pleasant, easy, fun to do. But so \\noften they are unimportant! \\nImportance, on the other hand, has to do with resu lts. If something is important, it contributes to \\nyour mission, your values, your high priority goals. \\n   We react to urgent matters.  Important matters that are not urgent require more initiative, more \\nproactivity. We must act to seize opportunity, to make things happen.  If we don\\'t practice Habit 2, if \\nwe don\\'t have a clear idea of what is important, of the results we desire in our lives, we are easily \\ndiverted into responding to the urgent. \\nLook for a moment at the four quadrants in the Time Management Matrix. Quadrant I is both \\nurgent and important. It deals with significant re sults that require immediate attention. We usually \\ncall the activities in Quadrant I \"crises\" or \"problems .\" We all have some Quadrant I activities in our \\nlives. But Quadrant I consumes many people. They  are crisis managers, problem-minded people, the \\ndeadline-driven producers. \\nAs long as you focus on Quadrant I, it keeps ge tting bigger and bigger until it dominates you. It\\'s \\nlike the pounding surf. A huge problem comes an d knocks you down and you\\'re wiped out. You \\nstruggle back up only to face another one that knocks you down and slams you to the ground. \\nSome people are literally beaten up by the proble ms all day every day. The only relief they have is \\nin escaping to the not important, no t urgent activities of Quadrant IV. So when you look at their total \\nmatrix, 90 percent of their time is in Quadrant I and mo st of the remaining 10 percent is in Quadrant IV '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 76}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nwith only negligible attention paid  to Quadrants II and III. That\\'s how people who manage their lives \\nby crisis live. \\nThere are other people who spend a great deal of time in \"urgent, but not important\" Quadrant III, \\nthinking they\\'re in Quadrant I. They spend most of  their time reacting to things that are urgent, \\nassuming they are also important. But the reality is  that the urgency of these matters is often based on \\nthe priorities and expectations of others. \\nPeople who spend time almost exclusively in Quad rants III and IV basically lead irresponsible lives. \\nEffective people stay out of Quadrants III and IV because, urgent or not, they aren\\'t important. \\nThey also shrink Quadrant I down to size  by spending more time in Quadrant II. \\nQuadrant II is the heart of effective personal management. It deals with things that are not urgent, \\nbut are important. It deals wi th things like building relationsh ips, writing a personal mission \\nstatement, long-range planning, exercising, preventi ve maintenance, preparation -- all those things we \\nknow we need to do, but somehow seldom get around to doing, because they aren\\'t urgent. \\nTo paraphrase Peter Drucker, effective people are not problem-minded; they\\'re opportunity-minded. \\nThey feed opportunities and starve problems.  They think preventively. They have genuine \\nQuadrant I crises and emergencies that require their immediate attention, but the number is \\ncomparatively small. They keep P and PC in balance by focusing on the import ant, but not the urgent, \\nhigh-leverage capacity-building activities of Quadrant II. \\nWith the Time Management Matrix in mind, take a moment now and consider how you answered \\nthe questions at the beginning of this chapter. What  quadrant do they fit in? Are they important? \\nAre they urgent? \\nMy guess is that they probably fit into Qu adrant II.  They are obviously important, deeply \\nimportant, but not urgent. And because they aren\\'t urgent, you don\\'t do them. \\nNow look again at the nature of those questions:  What one thing could you do in your personal and \\nprofessional life that, if you did on a regular basi s, would make a tremendous positive difference in \\nyour life? Quadrant II activities have that kind of  impact. Our effectiveness takes the quantum leaps \\nwhen we do them. \\nI asked a similar question to a group of shopping center managers . \"If you were to do one thing in \\nyour professional work that you know would have enormously positive effects on the results, what \\nwould it be?\" Their unanimous resp onse was to build helpful personal relationships with the tenants, \\nthe owners of the stores inside the shoppi ng center, which is a Quadrant II activity. \\nWe did an analysis of the time they were spendi ng on that activity. It was less than 5 percent. \\nThey had good reasons -- problems, one right after an other. They had reports to make out, meetings \\nto go to, correspondence to answer, phone calls to make, constant interruptions. Quadrant I had \\nconsumed them. \\nThey were spending very little time with the store managers, and the time they did spend was filled \\nwith negative energy. The only reason they visited the store mana gers at all was to enforce the \\ncontract -- to collect the money or discuss advertising or other practice s that were out of harmony with \\ncenter guidelines, or some similar thing. \\nThe store owners were struggling for survival , let alone prosperity. They had employment \\nproblems, cost problems, inventory problems, and a host of other problems. Most of them had no \\ntraining in management at all. Some were fairly  good merchandisers, but they needed help. The \\ntenants didn\\'t even want to see the shopping ce nter owners; they were just one more problem to \\ncontend with. \\nSo the owners decided to be proactive. The y determined their purpose, their values, their priorities. \\nIn harmony with those priorities, they decided to  spend about one-third of their time in helping \\nrelationships with the tenants. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 77}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nIn working with that organization for about a ye ar and a half, I saw them c limb to around 20 percent, \\nwhich represented more than a fourfold increase. In addition, they changed their role. They became \\nlisteners, trainers, consultants to the tenants. Th eir interchanges were filled with positive energy. \\n   The effect was dramatic, profound.  By focusing  on relationships and results rather than time and \\nmethods, the numbers went up, the tenants were thrilled with the results created by new ideas and skills, and the shopping center mana gers were more effective and satisfied and increased their list of \\npotential tenants and lease revenue based on increased sales by the tenant stores. They were no longer \\npolicemen or hovering supervisors. They were problem solvers, helpers. \\nWhether you are a student at the university, a worker in an assembly line, a homemaker, fashion \\ndesigner, or president of a company, I believe that if you were to ask what lies in Quadrant II and cultivate the proactivity to go after it, you would find the same results. Your effectiveness would \\nincrease dramatically. Your crises and problems would shrink to manageable proportions because \\nyou would be thinking ahead, working on the roots, doing the preventive things that keep situations \\nfrom developing into crises in the first place. In the time management jargon, this is called the Pareto \\nPrinciple -- 80 percent of the results flow out of 20 percent of the activities. \\nWhat it Takes to Say \"No\" \\nThe only place to get time for Quadrant II in th e beginning is from Quadrants III and IV. You can\\'t \\nignore the urgent and important activities of Quadrant  I, although it will shrink in size as you spend \\nmore time with prevention and preparation in Quadra nt II. But the initial time for Quadrant II has \\ncome out of III and IV. \\nYou have to be proactive to work on Quadrant II because Quadrant I and III work on you. To say \\n\"yes\" to important Quadrant II priorities, you have to  learn to say \"no\" to other activities, sometimes \\napparently urgent things. \\nSome time ago, my wife was invited to serve as chairman of a committee in a community endeavor. \\nShe had a number of truly important things she was tryi ng to work on, and she re ally didn\\'t want to do \\nit. But she felt pressured into it and finally agreed. \\nThen she called one of her dear friends to ask if she would serve on her committee. Her friend \\nlistened for a long time and then said, \"Sandra, that  sounds like a wonderful project, a really worthy \\nundertaking. I appreciate so much your inviting me to be a part of it. I feel honored by it. For a \\nnumber of reasons, I won\\'t be participating myself, but I want you to know how much I appreciate your \\ninvitation.\" \\nSandra was ready for anything but a pleasant \"no.\" She turned to me and sighed, \"I wish I\\'d said \\nthat.\" \\nI don\\'t mean to imply that you shouldn\\'t be invo lved in significant service projects. Those things \\nare important. But you have to decide what your  highest priorities are and have the courage --\\npleasantly, smiling, nonapologetically -- to say \"no\" to other things. And the way you do that is by \\nhaving a bigger \"yes\" burning inside. The enemy of the \"best\" is often the \"good.\" \\nK e e p  i n  m i n d  t h a t  y o u  a r e  a l w a y s  s a y i n g  \" n o \" to something. If it isn\\'t to the apparent, urgent \\nthings in your life, it is probably to the more fundamental, highly important things. Even when the \\nurgent is good, the good can keep you from your best , keep you from your uniq ue contributions, if you \\nlet it. \\nWhen I was Director of University Relations at a large university, I hired a very talented, proactive, \\ncreative writer. One day, after he had been on the job for a few months, I went into his office and \\nasked him to work on some urgent matters that were pressing on me. \\nHe said, \"Stephen, I\\'ll do whatever you want me  to do. Just let me share with you my situation.\" \\nThen he took me over to his wall board, where he had listed over two dozen projects he was '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 78}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nworking on, together with performance criteria an d deadline dates that had been clearly negotiated \\nbefore. He was highly disciplined, which is why I went to see him in the first place. \"If you want to \\nget something done, give it to a busy man.\" \\nThen he said, \"Stephen, to do the jobs that yo u want done right would take several days. Which of \\nthese projects would you like me to delay or cancel to satisfy your request?\" \\nWell, I didn\\'t want to take the responsibility for that. I didn\\'t want to put a cog in the wheel of one \\nof the most productive people on the staff just becaus e I happened to be managing by crisis at the time. \\nThe jobs I wanted done were urgent , but not important. So I went and found another crisis manager \\nand gave the job to him. \\nWe say \"yes\" or \"no\" to things daily, usually many times a day. A center of correct principles and a \\nfocus on our personal mission empowers us with wisdom to make those judgments effectively. \\nAs I work with different groups, I tell them that  the essence of effective time and life management is \\nto organize and execute around balanced priorities. Then I ask this questi on: if you were to fault \\nyourself in one of three areas, which would it be: (1) the inability to prioritize; (2) the inability or desire \\nto organize around those priorities; or (3) the lack of discipline to execute aro und them, to stay with \\nyour priorities and organization? \\nMost people say their main fault is a lack of discipline. On deeper thought, I believe that is not the \\ncase. The basic problem is that their priorities have not become deeply planted in their hearts and \\nminds. They haven\\'t really internalized Habit 2. \\nThere are many people who recognize the value of Quadrant II activities in their lives, whether they \\nidentify them as such or not. And they attempt to  give priority to those activities and integrate them \\ninto their lives through self-discipline alone. But without a principle center and a personal mission \\nstatement, they don\\'t have the necessary foundation to sustain their efforts. They\\'re working on the \\nleaves, on the attitudes and the behaviors of disciplin e, without even thinking to examine the roots, the \\nbasic paradigms from which their na tural attitudes and behaviors flow. \\nA Quadrant II focus is a paradigm that grows out of  a principle center. If you are centered on your \\nspouse, your money, your friends, your pleasure, or  any extrinsic factor, you will keep getting thrown \\nback into Quadrants I and III, reac ting to the outside forces your lif e is centered on. Even if you\\'re \\ncentered on yourself, you\\'ll end up in I and II reacting to the impulse of the moment.  Your \\nindependent will alone cannot effectively discipline you against your center. \\nIn the words of the architectural maxim, form  follows function. Likewise, management follows \\nleadership. The way you spend your time is a resu lt of the way you see your time and the way you \\nreally see your priorities. If your priorities grow out of a principle center and a personal mission, if they are deeply planted in your heart and in your mind, you will see Quadrant II as a natural, exciting \\nplace to invest your time. \\nIt\\'s almost impossible to say, \"no\" to the popul arity of Quadrant III or to the pleasure of escape to \\nQuadrant IV if you don\\'t have a bigger \"yes\" burning inside. Only when you have the self-awareness \\nto examine your program -- an d the imagination and conscience  to create a new, unique, \\nprinciple-centered program to which you can sa y \"yes\" -- only then will you have sufficient \\nindependent will power to say \"no,\" with a genuine smile, to the unimportant. \\nMoving Into Quadrant II \\nIf Quadrant II activities are clearly the heart of effective personal management -- the \"first things\" we \\nneed to put first -- then how do we or ganize and execute around those things \\nThe first generation of time management does no t even recognize the concept of priority. It gives \\nus notes and \"to do\" lists that we can cross off, an d we feel a temporary sense of accomplishment every \\ntime we check something off, but no priority is attach ed to items on the list. In addition, there is no '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 79}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\ncorrelation between what\\'s on the list and our ulti mate values and purposes in life.  We simply \\nrespond to whatever penetrates our aware ness and apparently needs to be done. \\nMany people manage from this first-generation paradigm.  It\\'s the course of least resistance. \\nThere\\'s no pain or strain; it\\'s fun to \"go with the flow.\" Externally imposed disciplines and schedules \\ngive people the feeling that they  aren\\'t responsible for results. \\nBut first-generation managers, by definition, are not effective people.  They  produce very little, and \\ntheir life-style does nothing to build their Production  Capability. Buffeted by outside forces, they are \\noften seen as undependable and irresponsible, and they have very little sense of control and self-esteem. \\nSecond-generation managers assume a little more control. They plan an d schedule in advance and \\ngenerally are seen as more responsible beca use they \"show up\" when they\\'re supposed to. \\nBut again, the activities they schedule have no priority or recognized correlation to deeper values \\nand goals. They have few significant achi evements and tend to be schedule-oriented. \\nThird-generation managers take a significant step forward. They clarify their values and set goals. \\nThey plan each day and pr ioritize their activities. \\nAs I have said, this is where most of the time-m anagement field is today. But this third generation \\nhas some critical limitations. First, it limits vision  -- daily planning often misses important things that \\ncan only be seen from a larger perspective. The ve ry language \"daily planning\" focuses on the urgent \\n-- the \"now.\" While third generation prioritization pr ovides order to activity, it doesn\\'t question the \\nessential importance of the activity in the first plac e -- it doesn\\'t place the activity in the context of \\nprinciples, personal mission, role s, and goals.  The third-generat ion value-driven daily planning \\napproach basically prioritizes the Quadrant I and III problems and crises of the day. \\nIn addition, the third generation makes no provision for managing roles in a balanced way. It lacks \\nrealism, creating the tendency to over-schedule th e day, resulting in frustration and the desire to \\noccasionally throw away the plan and escape to Quadrant  IV.  And its e fficiency, time-management \\nfocus tends to strain relation ships rather than build them. \\nWhile each of the three generations has recogn ized the value of some kind of management tool, \\nnone has produced a tool that empowers a person to live a principle- centered, Quadrant II life-style. \\nThe first-generation note pads and \"to do\" lists give us no more than a place to capture those things that \\npenetrate our awareness so we won\\'t forget them. The second-generation appointment books and \\ncalendars merely provide a place to record our fu ture commitments so that  we can be where we have \\nagreed to be at the appropriate time. \\nEven the third generation, with its vast array of planners and materials, focuses primarily on helping \\npeople prioritize and plan their Quadrant I and III ac tivities. Though many trainers and consultants \\nrecognize the value of Quadrant II activities, the actu al planning tools of the third generation do not \\nfacilitate organizing and executing around them. \\nAs each generation builds on those that have prec eded it, the strengths and some of the tools of each \\nof the first three generations provide elemental material for the fourth. But there is an added need for \\na new dimension, for the paradigm and the implem entation that will empow e r  u s  t o  m o v e  i n t o \\nQuadrant II, to become principle-centered and to mana ge ourselves to do what is truly most important. \\nThe Quadrant II Tool \\nThe objective of Quadrant II management is to ma nage our lives effectively -- from a center of sound \\nprinciples, for a knowledge of our pe rsonal mission, with a focus on th e important as well as the urgent, \\nand within the framework of mainta ining a balance between increasing  our Production and increasing \\nour Production Capability \\nThis is, admittedly, an ambitious objective for peop le caught in the thick of thin things in Quadrants '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 80}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nIII and IV. But striving to achieve it will have a phenomenal impact on personal effectiveness. \\nA Quadrant II organizer will need  to meet six important criteria.\\n Coherence: Coherence suggests that there is harmony, unity, and integrity between your vision \\nand mission, your roles and goals, your priorities an d plans, and your desires and discipline. In your \\nplanner, there should be a place for your personal mission statement so that yo u can constantly refer to \\nit. There also needs to be a place for your roles and for both short- and long-term goals. \\nBalance: Your tool should help you to keep ba lance in your life, to identify your various roles and \\nkeep them right in front of you, so that you don\\' t neglect important areas such as your health, your \\nfamily, professional preparation, or personal development. \\nMany people seem to think that success in one are a can compensate for failure in other areas of life. \\nBut can it really? Perhaps it can for a limited time  in some areas. But can success in your profession \\ncompensate for a broken marriage, ruined health, or weakness in personal character?  True \\neffectiveness requires balance, and your tool  needs to help you create and maintain it. \\nQuadrant II Focus:. You need a tool that encourages you, motivates you, actually helps you spend \\nthe time you need in Quadrant II, so that you\\'re dealin g with prevention rather than prioritizing crises. \\nIn my opinion, the best way to do this is to organize your life on a weekly basis. You can still adapt and prioritize on a daily basis, but the fundamental thrust is organizing the week. \\nOrganizing on a weekly basis provides much greater balance and context than daily planning. \\nThere seems to be implicit cultural recognition of the week as a single, complete unit of time. Business, \\neducation, and many other facets of society ope rate within the framework of the week, designating \\ncertain days for focused investment and others for re laxation or inspiration. The basic Judeo-Christian \\nethic honors the Sabbath, the one day out of every seven set aside for uplifting purposes. \\nMost people think in terms of weeks. But mo st third-generation planning tools focus on daily \\nplanning. While they may help you prioritize your activities, they basically only help you organize \\ncrises and busywork. The key is not to prioritize  what\\'s on your schedul e, but to schedule your \\npriorities. And this can best be  done in the context of the week. \\nA \"People\" Dimension: You also need a tool th at deals with people, not just schedules.  While you \\ncan think in terms of efficiency in dealing with ti me, a principle-centered person thinks in terms of \\neffectiveness in dealing with pe ople.  There are times when principle-centered Quadrant II living \\nrequires the subordination of schedul es to people. Your tool needs to  reflect that value, to facilitate \\nimplementation rather than create guilt when a schedule is not followed. \\n   Flexibility:  Your planning tool should be your  servant, never your master. Since it has to work \\nfor you, it should be tailored to your style, your needs, your particular ways. \\nPortability: Your tool should also be portable, so that you can carry it with you most of the time. \\nYou may want to review your personal mission stat ement while riding the bus. You may want to \\nmeasure the value of a new opportunity against so mething you already have planned.  If your \\norganizer is portable, you will keep it with you so  that important data is always within reach. \\nSince Quadrant II is the heart of effective self -management, you need a t ool that moves you into \\nQuadrant II. My work with the fourth-generation concept has led to the creation of a tool specifically \\ndesigned according to the criteria listed above. But many good third-generation tools can easily be \\nadapted. Because the principles are sound, the prac tices or specific applications can vary from one \\nindividual to the next. \\nBecoming a Quadrant II Self-Manager \\nAlthough my effort here is to teach principles, not practices, of effectiveness, I believe you can better \\nunderstand the principles and th e empowering nature of the fourth generation if you actually \\nexperience organizing a week from a principle-centered, Quadrant II base. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 81}, page_content=\"T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nQuadrant II organizing involves four key activities. \\n   Identifying Roles:  The first task is to write down your key roles. If you haven't really given \\nserious thought to the roles in your life, you can write down what immediately comes to mind. You \\nhave a role as an individual. You may want to lis t one or more roles as a family member -- a husband \\nor wife, mother or father, son or daughter, a member  of the extended family of grandparents, aunts, \\nuncles, and cousins. You may want to list a few role s in your work, indicating different areas in which \\nyou wish to invest time and energy on a regular basis. You may have roles in church or community \\naffairs. \\nYou don't need to worry about defining the roles in  a way that you will live wi th for the rest of your \\nlife -- just consider the week and write down the areas you see yourself spending time in during the \\nnext seven days. \\nHere are two examples of the way people might see their various roles. \\n1. Individual \\n2. Husband/Father \\n3. Manager New Products \\n4. Manager Research \\n5. Manager Staff Dev. \\n6. Manager Administration \\n7. Chairman United Way \\n1. Personal Development \\n2. Wife \\n3. Mother \\n4. Real Estate Salesperson \\n5. Sunday School Teacher \\n6. Symphony Board Member \\nSelecting Goals: The next step is to think of  two or three important results you feel you should \\naccomplish in each role during the next seven days. These would be recorded as goals. \\nAt least some of these goals should reflect Quadrant II activities. Ideally, these short-term goals \\nwould be tied to the longer-term goals you have identified in conjunction with your personal mission statement. But even if you haven't written your mi ssion statement, you can get a feeling, a sense, of \\nwhat is important as you consider each of yo ur roles and two or three goals for each role. \\nScheduling: Now you look at the week ahead with your goals in mind and schedule time to \\nachieve them. For example, if your goal is to produce the first draft of your personal mission statement, you may want to set aside a two-hour bloc k of time on Sunday to work on it. Sunday (or \\nsome other day of the week that is special to you, yo ur faith, or your circumst ances) is often the ideal \\ntime to plan your more personally uplifting activities , including weekly organizing. It's a good time to \\ndraw back, to see inspiration, to look at your life in the context of principles and values. \\nIf you set a goal to become physically fit through exercise, you may want to set aside an hour three \\nor four days during the week, or possibly every day during the week, to accomplish that goal. There \\nare some goals that you may only be able to acco mplish during business hours, or some that you can \\nonly do on Saturday when your children are home. Can you begin to see some of the advantages of \\norganizing the week instead of the day? \\nHaving identified roles and set goals, you can tran slate each goal to a specific day of the week, either \\nas a priority item or, even better, as a specific a ppointment. You can also check your annual or \\nmonthly calendar for any appointments you may have previously made and evaluate their importance \\nin the context of your goals, transferring those you decide to keep to your schedule and making plans to \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 82}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nreschedule or cancel others. \\nAs you study the following weekly worksheet, ob serve how each of the 19 most important, often \\nQuadrant II, goals has been scheduled or translated into  a specific action plan. In addition, notice the \\nbox labeled \"Sharpen the Saw TM\" that provides a plac e to plan vital renewing Quadrant II activities in \\neach of the four human dimensions that will be explained in Habit 7. \\nEven with time set aside to accomplish 19 impo rtant goals during the week , look at the amount of \\nremaining unscheduled space on the worksheet! As well as empowering you to Put First Things First, \\nQuadrant II weekly organizing gives you the freedom and the flexibility to handle unanticipated events, \\nto shift appointments if you need to, to savor relati onships and interactions with  others, to deeply enjoy \\nspontaneous experiences, knowing that you have proactively organized your week to accomplish key \\ngoals in every area of your life. \\nDaily Adapting: With Quadrant II weekly orga nizing, daily planning becomes more a function of \\ndaily adapting, or prioritizing activities and resp onding to unanticipated events, relationships, and \\nexperiences in a meaningful way. \\nTaking a few minutes each morning to revi ew your schedule can put you in touch with the \\nvalue-based decisions you made as you organized th e week as well as unanticipated factors that may \\nhave come up. As you overview the day, you can see that your roles and goals provide a natural \\nprioritization that grows out of your innate sense of balance.  It is a softer, more right-brain \\nprioritization that ultimately comes ou t of your sense of personal mission. \\nYou may still find that the third-generation A, B, C or 1, 2, 3 prioritizat ion gives needed order to \\ndaily activities. It would be a false dichotomy to say that activities are either important or they aren\\'t. \\nThey are obviously on a continuum, and some importan t activities are more impo rtant than others. In \\nthe context of weekly organizing, third-generatio n prioritization gives order to daily focus. \\nBut trying to prioritize activities before you ev en know how they relate to your sense of personal \\nmission and how they fit into the balance of your lif e is not effective. You may be prioritizing and \\naccomplishing things you don\\'t want  or need to be doing at all. \\nCan you begin to see the difference between organizing your week as a principle-centered, \\nQuadrant II manager and planning your days as an individual centered on something else? Can you \\nbegin to sense the tremendous difference the Quadrant II focus would make in your current level of \\neffectiveness? \\nHaving experienced the power of principle-ce ntered Quadrant II organizing in my own life and \\nhaving seen it transform the lives of hundreds of ot her people, I am persuaded it makes a difference -- a \\nquantum positive difference. And the more comple tely weekly goals are tied into a wider framework \\nof correct principles and into a personal mission stat ement, the greater the increase in effectiveness will \\nbe. \\nLiving It \\nReturning once more to the computer metaphor, if Habit 1 says \"You\\'re the programmer\" and Habit \\n2 says \"Write the program,\" then Habit 3 says \"Run the program,\" \"Live the program.\" And living it is \\nprimarily a function of our independent will, our sel f-discipline, our integrity, and commitment -- not to \\nshort-term goals and schedules or to the impulse of  the moment, but to the correct principles and our \\nown deepest values, which give meaning and cont ext to our goals, our schedules, and our lives. \\nAs you go through your week, there will undoub tedly be times when your integrity will be placed \\non the line. The popularity of reacting to the urge nt but unimportant priorities of other people in \\nQuadrant III or the pleasure of escaping to Quad rant IV will threaten to overpower the important \\nQuadrant II activities you have planned. Your principle center, your self-awareness, and your conscience can provide a high degree of intrinsic security, guidance, and wisdom to empower you to '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 83}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nuse your independent will and maintain  integrity to the truly important. \\nBut because you aren\\'t omniscient, you can\\'t alwa ys know in advance what is truly important. As \\ncarefully as you organize the week, these will be ti mes when, as a principle-centered person, you will \\nneed to subordinate your schedule to a higher valu e. Because you are principle-centered, you can do \\nthat with an inner sense of peace. \\nAt one point, one of my sons was deeply into  scheduling and efficiency. One day he had a very \\ntight schedule, which included down-to-the-minute time allocations for every activity, including \\npicking up some books, washing his car, and \"dropping\" Carol, his girlfriend, among other things. \\nEverything went according to sch edule until it came to Carol. They had been dating for a long \\nperiod of time, and he had finally come to the conc lusion that a continued re lationship would not work \\nout. So, congruent with his efficiency mode, he had scheduled a 10- to 15-minute telephone call to tell \\nher. \\nBut the news was very traumatic to her. One-an d-a-half hours later, he was still deeply involved in \\na very intense conversation with her. Even then, the one visit was not enough. The situation was a \\nvery frustrating experience for them both. \\nAgain, you simply can\\'t think efficiency with  people. You think effect iveness with people and \\nefficiency with things. I\\'ve tried to be \"efficien t\" with a disagreeing or disagreeable person and it \\nsimply doesn\\'t work. I\\'ve tried to give 10 minutes of \"quality time\" to a child or an employee to solve a \\nproblem, only to discover such \"efficiency\" crea tes new problems and seldom resolves the deepest \\nconcern. \\nI see many parents, particularly mothers with small children, often frustrated in their desire to \\naccomplish a lot because all they seem to do is meet the needs of little children all day. Remember, frustration is a function of our expectations, and our expectations are often a reflection of the social \\nmirror rather than our own values and priorities. \\nBut if you have Habit 2 deep inside your heart and mind, you have those higher values driving you. \\nYou can subordinate your schedule to those values with  integrity. You can adapt; you can be flexible. \\nYou don\\'t feel guilty when you don\\'t meet your  schedule or when you have to change it. \\nAdvances of the Fourth Generation \\nOne of the reasons why people resist using third-generation time management tools is because they \\nlose spontaneity; they become rigid and inflexible. They subordinate people to schedules because the \\nefficiency paradigm of the third generation of manage ment is out of harmony with the principle that \\npeople are more important than things. \\n   The fourth-generation tool recognizes that principle. It also re cognizes that the first person you \\nneed to consider in terms of effect iveness rather than efficiency is your self. It encourages you to spend \\ntime in Quadrant II, to understand and center your li fe on principles, to give clear expression to the \\npurposes and values you want to direct your daily deci sions. It helps you create balance in your life. \\nIt helps you rise above the limitations of daily plan ning and organize and schedule in the context of the \\nweek. And when a higher value conflicts with what you have planne d, it empowers you to use your \\nself-awareness and your conscience to maintain in tegrity to the principles and purposes you have \\ndetermined are most important. Instead of  using a road map, you\\'re using a compass. \\nThe fourth generation of self-management is more  advanced than the third in five important ways. \\n   First, it\\'s principle-centered.  More than givi ng lip service to Quadrant II, it creates the central \\nparadigm that empowers you to see your time in the context of what is really important and effective \\nSecond, it\\'s conscience-directed.  It gives you the opportunity to organize your life to the best of \\nyour ability in harmony with your deepest values. But it also gives you the freedom to peacefully \\nsubordinate your schedule to higher values.

This gives direction \\nand purpose to the way you spend each day. \\nFourth, it helps you balance your life by iden tifying roles, and by se tting goals and scheduling \\nactivities in each key role every week. \\nAnd fifth, it gives greater context through weekly organizing (with daily adaptation as needed), \\nrising above the limiting perspective of a single day and putting you in touch with your deepest values \\nthrough review of your key roles. \\nThe practical thread running through all five of  these advances is a primary focus on relationships \\nand results and a secondary focus on time. \\nDelegation: Increasing P and PC \\nWe accomplish all that we do through delegation -- either to time or to other people. If we \\ndelegate to time, we think efficiency. If we de legate to other people, we think effectiveness. \\nMany people refuse to delegate to other people because they feel it takes too much time and effort \\nand they could do the job better themselves. But effe ctively delegating to others is perhaps the single \\nmost powerful high-leverage activity there is. \\nTransferring responsibility to other skilled and t rained people enables you to give your energies to \\nother high-leverage activities. Delegation means gr owth, both for individuals and for organizations. \\nThe late J. C. Penney was quoted as saying that the wisest decision he ever ma de was to \"let go\" after \\nrealizing that he couldn\\'t do it all by himself any longer. That decision, made long ago, enabled the \\ndevelopment and growth of hundreds of stores and thousands of people. \\nBecause delegation involves other people, it is a Public Victory and could well be included in Habit \\n4. But because we are focusing here on principles of personal management, and the ability to delegate \\nto others is the main difference between the role of manager and independent producer, I am \\napproaching delegation from the standpoi nt of your personal managerial skills. \\nA producer does whatever is necessary to accomplish desired results, to get the golden eggs. A \\nparent who washes the dishes, an architect who draws up blueprints, or a secretary who types \\ncorrespondence is a producer. \\nBut when a person sets up and works with and through people and systems to produce golden eggs, \\nthat person becomes a manager in the interdepende nt sense. A parent who delegates washing the \\ndishes to a child is a manager. An architect who heads a team of other architects is a manager. A \\nsecretary who supervises other secretaries and office personnel is an office manager. \\nA producer can invest one hour of effort and produce one unit of result s, assuming no loss of \\nefficiency. \\nA manager, on the other hand, can invest one hour of effort and produce 10 or 50 or 100 units \\nthrough effective delegation. \\nManagement is essentially moving the fulcrum  over, and the key to effective management is \\ndelegation. \\nGofer Delegation \\nThere are basically two kinds of delegation: \"gofer delegation\" and \"stewardship delegation.\" Gofer \\ndelegation means \"Go for this, go for that, do this, do  that, and tell me when it\\'s done.\" Most people \\nwho are producers have a gofer delegation paradigm. Remember the machete wielders in the jungle? \\nThey are the producers. They roll up their sleeves and get the job done. If they are given a position \\nof supervision or management, they still think like producers. They don\\'t know how to set up a full \\ndelegation so that another person is committed to  achieve results.  Because they are focused on '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 85}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nmethods, they become responsible for the results. \\nI was involved in a gofer delegation once when our family went water skiing. My son, who is an \\nexcellent skier, was in the water being pulled and I was driving the boat. I handed the camera to \\nSandra and asked her to take some pictures. \\nAt first, I told her to be selective in her pictur e taking because we didn\\'t have much film left. Then I \\nrealized she was unfamiliar with the camera, so I became  a little more specific. I told her to be sure to \\nwait until the sun was ahead of the boat and until our son was jumping the wake or making a turn and \\ntouching his elbow. \\nBut the more I thought about our limited foot age and her inexperience with the camera, the more \\nconcerned I became. I finally said, \"Look, Sandra, ju st push the button when I tell you. Okay? And \\nI spent the next few minutes yelling, \"Take it! -- Take it! -- Don\\'t take it! -- Don\\'t take it!\" I was afraid \\nthat if I didn\\'t direct her every move every second, it wouldn\\'t be done right. \\nThat was true gofer delegation, one-on-one supervision of methods. Many people consistently \\ndelegate that way. But how much does it really accomplish? And how many people is it possible to supervise or manage when you have to be involved in every move they make? \\nThere\\'s a much better way, a more effective way to delegate to other people. And it\\'s based on a \\nparadigm of appreciation of the self-awareness, th e imagination, the conscience, and the free will of \\nother people. \\nStewardship Delegation \\nStewardship delegation is focused on results in stead of methods. It gives people a choice of \\nmethod and makes them responsible for results. It takes more time in the beginning, but it\\'s time well \\ninvested. You can move the fulcr um over, you can increase your leverage, through stewardship \\ndelegation.\\n   Stewardship delegation involves clear, up-fr ont mutual understanding and commitment regarding \\nexpectations in five areas. \\nDesired Results: Create a clear, mutual understanding of what needs to be accomplished, focusing \\non what, not how; results, not methods. Spend ti me.  Be patient. Visualize the desired result. \\nHave the person see it, describe it, make out a quality statement of what the results will look like, and \\nby when they will be accomplished. \\nGuidelines: Identify the parameters within whic h the individual should op erate.  These should be \\nas few as possible to avoid methods delegation, but should include any formidable restrictions. You \\nwon\\'t want a person to think he had considerable la titude as long as he accomplished the objectives, \\nonly to violate some long-standing traditional practice  or value. That kills initiative and sends people \\nback to the gofer\\'s creed: \"Just tell me what you want me to do, and I\\'ll do it.\" \\nIf you know the failure paths of the job, identi fy them. Be honest and open -- tell a person where \\nthe quicksand is and where the wild animals are. Yo u don\\'t want to have to reinvent the wheel every \\nday. Let people learn from your mistakes or the mistakes of others. Point out the potential failure \\npaths, what not to do, but don\\'t tell them what to do . Keep the responsibility for results with them -- \\nto do whatever is necessary within the guidelines. \\n   Resources:  Identify the human, financial, technical, or organizational resources the person can \\ndraw on to accomplish the desired results. \\n   Accountability:  Set up the standards of performa nce that will be used in evaluating the results and \\nthe specific times when reporting and evaluation will take place. \\nConsequences: Specify what will happen, both go od and bad, as a result of the evaluation. This \\ncould include such things as financial rewards, psyc hic rewards, different job assignments, and natural \\nconsequences tied into the overall mission of an organization.

We were \\nhaving a family meeting, and we had our mission statement up on the wall to make sure our plans \\nwere in harmony with our values. Everybody was there. \\nI set up a big blackboard and we wrote down ou r goals -- the key things we wanted to do -- and the \\njobs that flowed out of those goals. Th en I asked for volunteers to do the job. \\n\"Who wants to pay the mortgage?\" I asked. I noticed I was the only one with my hand up. \\n\"Who wants to pay for the insurance? The food? The cars?\" I seem ed to have a real monopoly on \\nthe opportunities. \\n\"Who wants to feed the new baby?\" There was more interest here, but my wife was the only one \\nwith the right qualifications for the job. \\nAs we went down the list, jo b by job, it was soon evident that Mom and Dad had more than \\nsixty-hour work weeks.  With that paradigm in mind, some of the other jobs took on a more proper perspective. \\nMy seven-year-old son, Stephen, volunteered to ta ke care of the yard. Before I actually gave him a \\njob, I began a thorough training process. I wanted him to have a clear picture in his mind of what a \\nwell-cared-for yard was like, so I took him next door to our neighbor\\'s. \\n\"Look, son,\" I said. \"See how our neighbor\\'s yard is green and clean? That \\'s what we\\'re after: green \\nand clean. Now come look at our yard. See the mi xed colors? That\\'s not it; that\\'s not green. Green \\nand clean is what we want. Now how you get it green is up to you. You\\'re free to do it any way you \\nwant, except paint it. But I\\'ll tell you how I\\'d do it if it were up to me.\" \\n\"How would you do it, Dad?\" \\n\"I\\'d turn on the sprinklers. But you may want to use buckets or a hose. It makes no difference to \\nme. All we care about is that the color is green. Okay?\" \\n\"Okay.\" \\n\"Now let\\'s talk about \\'clean,\\' Son. Clean means no messes around -- no pape r, strings, bones, sticks, \\nor anything that messes up the place. I\\'ll tell you what  let\\'s do. Let\\'s just clean up half of the yard \\nright now and look at the difference.\" \\nSo we got out two paper sacks and picked up one side of the yard. \"Now look at this side. Look \\nat the other side. See the difference? That\\'s called clean.\" \\n\"Wait!\" he called. \"I see some paper behind that bush!\" \\n\"Oh, good! I didn\\'t notice that newspaper back there. You have good eyes, Son.\" \\n\"Now before you decide whether or not you\\'re go ing to take the job, let me tell you a few more \\nthings. Because when you take the job, I don\\'t do it anymore. It\\'s your job. It\\'s called a stewardship. \\nStewardship means \\'a job with  a trust.\\' I trust you to do the job, to get it done. Now who\\'s going to be \\nyour boss?\"\\n   \"You, Dad?\" \\n   \"No, not me.  You\\'re the boss.  You boss your self. How do you like Mom and Dad nagging you \\nall the time?\"    \"I don\\'t.\" \\n\"We don\\'t like doing it either. It sometimes caus es a bad feeling doesn\\'t it? So you boss yourself. \\nNow, guess who your helper is.\" \\n   \" W h o ? \"\\n   \"I am,\" I said.  \"You boss me.\" \\n   \" I d o ? \" \\n\"That\\'s right. But my time to help is limited . Sometimes I\\'m away. But when I\\'m here, you tell \\nme how I can help. I\\'ll do anything you want me to do.\" \\n   \" O k a y ! \" \\n\"Now guess who judges you.\" '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 87}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t\\n   \" W h o ? \"\\n   \"You judge yourself.\" \\n   \" I d o ? \" \\n\"That\\'s right. Twice a week the two of us will walk around the yard and yo u can show me how it\\'s \\ncoming. How are you going to judge?\" \\n   \"Green and clean.\" \\n   \" R i g h t ! \" \\nI trained him with those two words for two weeks before I felt he was ready to take the job. Finally, \\nthe big day came. \\n\"Is it a deal, Son?\" \\n   \"It\\'s a deal.\" \\n   \"What\\'s the job?\" \\n   \"Green and clean.\" \\n   \"What\\'s green?\" \\nHe looked at our yard, which was beginning to look better. Then he pointed next door. \"That\\'s \\nthe color of his yard.\" \\n   \"What\\'s clean?\" \\n   \"No messes.\" \\n   \"Who\\'s the boss?\" \\n   \"I am.\" \\n   \"Who\\'s your helper?\" \\n\"You are, when you have time.\" \\n   \"Who\\'s the judge?\" \\n\"I am. We\\'ll walk around two times a week and I can show you how it\\'s coming.\" \\n\"And what will we look for?\" \\n   \"Green and clean.\" \\nAt that time I didn\\'t mention an allowance. But I wouldn\\'t hesitate to attach an allowance to such a \\nstewardship. \\nTwo weeks and two words. I thought he was ready. \\n   It was Saturday.  And he did nothing.  Sunday...nothing. Monday...nothing. As I pulled out of \\nthe driveway on my way to work on Tuesday, I look ed at the yellow, cluttered yard and the hot July \\nsun on its way up. \"Surely he\\'ll do it today,\" I thought. I could rationalize Saturday because that was the day we made the agreement. I could rationali ze Sunday; Sunday was for other things. But I \\ncouldn\\'t rationalize Monday. And now it was Tuesday.  Certainly he\\'d do it today. It was \\nsummertime. What else did he have to do? \\nAll day I could hardly wait to return home to  see what happened. As I rounded the corner, I was \\nmet with the same picture I left that morning. And there was my son at the park across the street \\nplaying. \\nThis was not acceptable. I was upset and di sillusioned by his performance after two weeks of \\ntraining and all those commitments. We had a lot of effort, pride, and money invested in the yard and \\nI could see it going down the drain. Besides, my  neighbor\\'s yard was manicured and beautiful, and \\nthe situation was beginning to get embarrassing. \\nI was ready to go back to gofer delegation. So n, you get over here and pick up this garbage right \\nnow or else! I knew I could get the golden egg that  way. But what about the goose? What would \\nhappen to his internal commitment? \\nSo I faked a smile and yelled across the street, \"Hi, Son. How\\'s it going?\" \\n   \"Fine!\" he returned. \\n\"How\\'s the yard coming?\" I knew the minute I said it I had broken our ag reement.  That\\'s not the '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 88}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nway we had set up an accounting. That\\'s not what we had agreed. \\n\"How\\'s the yard coming?\" I knew the minute I said it I had broken our ag reement.  That\\'s not the \\nway we had set up an accounting. That\\'s not what we had agreed. \\nSo he felt justified in breaking it, too. \"Fine, Dad.\" \\nI bit my tongue and waited until after dinner. Th en I said, \"Son, let\\'s do as we agreed. Let\\'s walk \\naround the yard together and you can show me how it\\'s going in your stewardship.\" \\nAs we started out the door, his chin began to quiv er. Tears welled up in his eyes and, by the time \\nwe got out to the middle of the yard, he was whimpering. \\n   \"It\\'s so hard, Dad!\" \\n   What\\'s so hard?  I thought to myself.  You haven\\'t done a single thing! But I knew what was \\nhard -- self management, self-supervision. So I said, \"Is there anything I can do to help?\" \\n\"Would you, Dad?\" he sniffed \\n   \"What was our agreement?\" \\n\"You said you\\'d help me if you had time.\" \\n   \"I have time.\" \\nSo he ran into the house and came back with tw o sacks. He handed me one. \"Will you pick that \\nstuff up?\" He pointed to the garbage from Satu rday night\\'s barbecue. \"It makes me sick!\" \\nSo I did. I did exactly what he asked me to do. And that was when he  signed the agreement in \\nhis heart. It became his yard, his stewardship. \\nHe only asked for help two or three more times th at entire summer. He took  care of that yard. He \\nkept it greener and cleaner than it had ever been under my stewardship. He even reprimanded his \\nbrothers and sisters if they left so  much as a gum wrapper on the lawn. \\nTrust is the highest form of human motivation. It  brings out the very best in people. But it takes \\ntime and patience, and it doesn\\'t preclude the ne cessity to train and develop people so that their \\ncompetency can rise to the level of that trust. \\nI am convinced that if stewardship delegation  is done correctly, both parties will benefit and \\nultimately much more work will ge t done in much less time. I believe that a family that is well \\norganized, whose time has been spent effectively de legating on a one-to-one basis, can organize the \\nwork so that everyone can do everything in about an hour a day. But that takes the internal capacity \\nto want to manage, not just produce. The focus is on effectiveness, not efficiency. \\nCertainly you can pick up that room better than  a child, but the key is that you want to empower the \\nchild to do it. It takes time. You have to get invo lved in the training and development. It takes time, \\nbut how valuable that time is downstream! It saves you so much in the long run. \\nThis approach involves an entirely new paradigm of delegation. In effect, it changes the nature of \\nthe relationship: The steward becomes his own bo ss, governed by a conscience that contains the \\ncommitment to agreed upon desired results. But it also releases his creative energies toward doing \\nwhatever is necessary in harmony with correct principles to achieve those desired results. \\nThe principles involved in stewardship delegati on are correct and applicable  to any kind of person \\nor situation. With immature people, you specify fewer desired results and more guidelines, identify \\nmore resources, conduct more frequent accoun tability interviews, and apply more immediate \\nconsequences. With more mature people, you have more challenging desired results, fewer guidelines, \\nless frequent accountability, and less meas urable but more discernible criteria. \\nEffective delegation is perhaps the best indicato r of effective management simply because it is so \\nbasic to both personal and organizational growth. \\nThe Quadrant II Paradigm \\nThe key to effective management of self, or of others through delegation, is not in any technique or '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 89}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\ntool or extrinsic factor. It is intrinsic -- in the Quadrant II paradig m that empowers you to see through \\nthe lens of importance rather than urgency. \\nI have included in the Appendix an exercise  called \"A Quadrant II Day at the Office\" which will \\nenable you to see in a business se tting how powerfully this paradigm can impact your effectiveness. \\nAs you work to develop a Quadrant II paradigm,  you will increase your ability to organize and \\nexecute every week of your life around your deepest priorities, to walk your talk. You will not be \\ndependent on any other person or thing fo r the effective management of your life. \\nInterestingly, every one of the Seven Habits is  in Quadrant II. Every one deals with fundamentally \\nimportant things that, if done on a regular basis, would make a tremendous positive difference in our \\nlives. \\nApplication Suggestions: \\n1. Identify a Quadrant II activity you know has been  neglected in your life -- one that, if done well, \\nwould have a significant impact in your life, either personally or professionally. Write it down and \\ncommit to implement it. \\n2. Draw a Time Management Matrix and try to estimate what percentage of your time you spend \\nin each quadrant. Then log your time for three da ys in 15-minute intervals. How accurate was your \\nestimate? Are you satisfied with the way you sp end your time? What do you need to change. \\n3. Make a list of responsibilities you could dele gate and the people you could delegate to or train \\nto be responsible in these areas.  Determine what is needed to start the process of delegation or \\ntraining. \\n4. Organize your next week.  Start by writing down your roles and goals for the week, then \\ntransfer the goals to a specific action plan. At  the end of the week, evaluate how well your plan \\ntranslated your deep values and purposes into your  daily life and the degree of integrity you were able \\nto maintain to those values and purposes. \\n5. Commit yourself to start organizing on a weekly basis and set up a regular time to do it. \\n6. Either convert your current planning tool in to a fourth generation tool or secure such a tool. \\n7. Go through \"A Quadrant II Day at the Office \" (Appendix B) for a more in-depth understanding \\nof the impact of a Quadrant II paradigm.

There aren\\'t any other roads;  there aren\\'t any shortcuts. There\\'s no way to \\nparachute into this terrain. The landscape ahead is covered with the fragments of broken relationships \\nof people who have tried.

You can't have the fruits without the roots. It's the principle of \\nsequencing: Private Victory precedes Public Vict ory.  Self-mastery and self-discipline are the \\nfoundation of good relationships with others. \\nSome people say that you have to like yourself before you can like others. I think that idea has \\nmerit, but if you don't know yourself, if you don't control yourself, if you don't have mastery over \\nyourself, it's very hard to like yourself, except  in some short-term, psych-up, superficial way. \\nReal self-respect comes from dominion over self , from true independence. And that's the focus of \\nHabits 1, 2, and 3. Independence is an achievement. Interdependence is a choice only independent \\npeople can make. Unless we are willing to achieve re al independence, it's foolish to try to develop \\nhuman-relations skills. We might try. We might even have some degree of success when the sun is \\nshining. But when the difficult times come -- and they will -- we wo n't have the foundation to keep \\nthings together. \\nThe most important ingredient we put into any relationship is not what we say or what we do, but \\nwhat we are. And if our words an d our actions come from superficial human-relations techniques (the \\npersonality ethic) rather than from our own inner core (the character ethic), others will sense that \\nduplicity. We simply won't be able to create and sustain the foundation necessary for effective \\ninterdependence. \\nThe techniques and skills that really make a diffe rence in human interaction are the ones that almost \\nnaturally flow from a truly independent character. So the place to begin building any relationship is \\ninside ourselves, inside our Circle of Influenc e, our own character. As we become independent -- \\nproactive, centered in correct principles, value dr iven and able to organize and execute around the \\npriorities in our life with integr ity -- we then can choose to beco me interdependent -- capable of \\nbuilding rich, enduring, highly producti ve relationships with other people. \\nAs we look at the terrai n ahead, we see that we're ente ring a whole new dimension. \\nInterdependence opens up worlds of possibilitie s for deep, rich, meaningful associations, for \\ngeometrically increased productivity, for serving, for contributing, for learning, for growing. But it is \\nalso where we feel the greatest pain , the greatest frustration, the greatest roadblocks to happiness and \\nsuccess. And we're very aware of that pain because it is acute. \\nWe can often live for years with the chronic pain of our lack of vision, lead ership or management in \\nour personal lives. We feel vaguely uneasy and uncomfortable and occasionally take steps to ease the pain, at least for a time. But the pain is chro nic, we get used to it, we learn to live with it. \\nBut when we have problems in our interactions with other people, we're very aware of acute pain -- \\nit's often intense, and we want it to go away. \\nThat's when we try to treat the symptoms with quick fixes and techniques -- the band-aids of the \\npersonality ethic. We don't understand that the acute pain is an outgrowth of the deeper, chronic \\nproblem. And until we stop treating the symptoms and start treati ng the problem, our efforts will \\nonly bring counterproductive results. We will only  be successful at obscuring the chronic pain even \\nmore. \\nNow, as we think of effective interaction with others, let's go back to our earlier definition of \\neffectiveness.  We've said it's th e P/PC Balance, the fundamental conc ept in the story of the Goose and \\nthe Golden Egg. \\nIn an interdependent situation, the golden e ggs are the effectiveness, the wonderful synergy, the \\nresults created by open communication  and positive interaction with ot hers. And to get those eggs on \\na regular basis, we need to take care of the goose. We need to create and care  for the relationships that \\nmake those results realities. \\nSo before we descend from our point of reconna issance and get into Habits 4, 5, and 6, I would like \\nto introduce what I believe to be a very powerful me taphor in describing relati onships and in defining \\nthe P/PC Balance in an interdependent reality. \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 92}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nThe Emotional Bank Account TM \\nWe all know what a financial bank account is. We make deposits into it and build up a reserve \\nfrom which we can make withdrawals when we need to.  An Emotional Bank Account is a metaphor \\nthat describes the amount of trust that\\'s been built up in a relationship. It\\'s the feeling of safeness you \\nhave with another human being. \\nIf I make deposits into an Emotional Bank A ccount with you through courtesy, kindness, honesty, \\nand keeping my commitments to you, I build up a re serve. Your trust toward me becomes higher, and \\nI can call upon that trust many times if I need to. I can even make mistakes and that trust level, that emotional reserve, will compensate for it. My co mmunication may not be clear, but you\\'ll get my \\nmeaning anyway. You won\\'t make me \"an offender for a word.\" When the trust account is high, \\ncommunication is easy, instant, and effective. \\nBut if I have a habit of showing discourtesy, disrespect, cutting you off, ov erreacting, ignoring you, \\nbecoming arbitrary, betraying your trust, threatening you, or playing little tin god in your life, \\neventually my Emotional Bank Account is overdrawn. The trust level gets very low. Then what \\nflexibility do I have? \\nNone. I\\'m walking on mine fields.  I have to be very careful of everything I say. I measure every \\nword. It\\'s tension city, memo heaven.  It\\'s protecting my backside, politicking.  And many \\norganizations are filled with it. Many families are filled with it. Many marriages are filled with it.\\n   If a large reserve of trust is  not sustained by continuing depo sits, a marriage will deteriorate. \\nInstead of rich, spontaneous understanding an d communication, the situation becomes one of \\naccommodation, where two people simply attempt to li ve independent life-styles in a fairly respectful \\nand tolerant way. The relationship may further dete riorate to one of hostility and defensiveness. The \\n\"fight or flight\" response creates verbal battles, slammed doors, refusal to talk, emotional withdrawal \\nand self-pity. It may end up in a cold war at home, sustained only by children, sex, and social pressure, \\nor image protection. Or it may en d up in open warfare in the courts , where bitter ego-decimating legal \\nbattles can be carried on for years as people endlessly confess the sins of a former spouse. \\nAnd this is in the most intimate, the most potentially rich, joyful, satisfying and productive \\nrelationship possible between two pe ople on this earth. The P/PC lig hthouse is there; we can either \\nbreak ourselves against it or we can use it as a guiding light. \\nOur most constant relationships, like marriage, require our most constant deposits.  With \\ncontinuing expectations, old deposits evaporate. If  you suddenly run into an old high school friend \\nyou haven\\'t seen for years, you can pick up right wher e you left off because the earlier deposits are still \\nthere. But your accounts with the people you inte ract with on a regular basis require more constant \\ninvestment. There are sometimes automatic withd rawals in your daily interactions or in their \\nperception of you that you don\\'t even  know about. This is especially  true with teenagers in the home. \\nSuppose you have a teenage son and your normal conversation is something like, \"Clean your room. \\nButton your shirt.  Turn down the radio.  Go ge t a haircut.  And don\\'t forget to take out the \\ngarbage!\" Over a period of time, the withdrawals far exceed the deposits. \\nNow, suppose this son is in the process of making some important decisions that will affect the rest \\nof his life. But the trust level is so low and th e communication process so  closed, mechanical, and \\nunsatisfying that he simply will not be open to  your counsel. You may have the wisdom and the \\nknowledge to help him, but because your account is so overdrawn, he will end up making his decisions \\nfrom a short-range emotional perspective, which may well result in many negative long-range \\nconsequences. \\nYou need a positive balance to communicate  on these tender issues. What do you do? \\nWhat would happen if you started making depo sits into the relationship?  Maybe the opportunity '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 93}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\ncomes up to do him a little kindness -- to bring home a magazine on skateboarding, if that\\'s his interest, \\nor just to walk up to him when he\\'s working on a project and offer help. Perhaps you could invite him \\nto go to a movie with you or take him out for some  ice cream. Probably the most important deposit \\nyou could make would be just to listen, with out judging or preaching or reading your own \\nautobiography into what he says. Just listen and s eek to understand. Let him feel your concern for \\nhim, your acceptance of him as a person. \\nHe may not respond at first.  He may even be suspicious.  \"What\\'s Dad up to now?  What \\ntechnique is Mom trying on me this time?\" But as  those genuine deposits keep coming, they begin to \\nadd up. That overdrawn balance is shrinking. \\nRemember that quick fix is a mirage. Buildin g and repairing relationsh ips takes time.  If you \\nbecome impatient with this apparent lack of respon se of his seeming ingratitude, you may make huge \\nwithdrawals and undo all the good you\\'ve done. \"Aft er all we\\'ve done for you, the sacrifices we\\'ve \\nmade, how can you be so ungrateful? We try to be nice and you act like this. I can\\'t believe it! \\nIt\\'s hard not to get impatient. It takes character to  be proactive, to focus on your Circle of Influence, \\nto nurture growing things, and not to \"pull up the flowers to see how the roots are coming.\" \\nBut there really is no quick fix. Building an d repairing relationships are long-term investments. \\nSix Major Deposits \\nLet me suggest six major deposits that build the Emotional Bank Account \\n   Understanding the Individual \\nReally seeking to understand another person is probably one of the most important deposits you can \\nmake, and it is the key to every other deposit. Yo u simply don\\'t know what constitutes a deposit to \\nanother person until you understand  that individual. What might be  a deposit for you -- going for a \\nwalk to talk things over, going out for ice cream together, working on a common project -- might not be \\nperceived by someone else as a deposit at all. It might even be perceived as a withdrawal, if it doesn\\'t \\ntouch the person\\'s deep interests or needs. \\nOne person\\'s mission is another person\\'s minutia. To make a deposit, what is important to another \\nperson must be as important to yo u as the other person is to you. You may be working on a high \\npriority project when your six-year-ol d child interrupts with something th at seems trivial to you, but it \\nmay be very important from his point of view. It takes Habit 2 to recognize and recommit yourself to \\nthe value of that person and Ha bit 3 to subordinate your schedul e to that human priority.  By \\naccepting the value he places on what he has to sa y, you show an understanding of him that makes a \\ngreat deposit. \\nI have a friend whose son developed an avid inte rest in baseball. My friend wasn\\'t interested in \\nbaseball at all. But one summer, he took his son to  see every major league team play one game. The \\ntrip took over six weeks and cost a great deal of money, but it became  a powerful bonding experience in \\ntheir relationship. \\nMy friend was asked on his return, \"Do you like baseball that much?\" \\n\"No,\" he replied, \"but I like my son that much.\" \\nI have another friend, a college professor, who had a terrible relationship with his teenage son. \\nThis man\\'s entire life was essentially academic, an d he felt his son was totally wasting his life by \\nworking with this hands instead of working to develop his mind.  As a result, he was almost \\nconstantly on the boy\\'s back, and, in  moments of regret, he would try to make deposits that just didn\\'t \\nwork. The boy perceived the gestur es as new forms of rejection, co mparison, and judgment, and they \\nprecipitated huge withdrawals. The relationship was turning sour, and it was breaking the father\\'s \\nheart. \\nOne day I shared with him this principle of ma king what is important to the other person as '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 94}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nimportant to you as the other person is to you. He  took it deeply to heart. He engaged his son in a \\nproject to build a miniature Wall of  China around their home. It wa s a consuming project, and they \\nworked side by side on it for over a year and a half. \\nThrough that bonding experience, the son moved th rough that phase in his lif e and into an increased \\ndesire to develop his mind. But the real benefit wa s what happened to the re lationship.  Instead of a \\nsore spot, it became a source of joy and strength to both father and son. \\nOur tendency is to project ou t of our own autobiographies what we think other people want or need. \\nWe project our intentions on the be havior of others. We interpret wh at constitutes a deposit based on \\nour own needs and desires, either no w or when we were at a similar age or  stage in life. If they don\\'t \\ninterpret our effort as a deposit, ou r tendency is to take it as a rejection of our well-intentioned effort \\nand give up. \\nThe Golden Rule says to \"Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.\" While on the \\nsurface that could mean to do for them what you would like to have done for you, I think the more \\nessential meaning is to understand them deeply as individuals, the way you would want to be \\nunderstood, and then to treat them in terms of th at understanding. As one successful parent said \\nabout raising children, \"Treat them all the same by treating them differently.\" \\nAttending to the Little Things \\nThe little kindnesses and courtesies are so import ant. Small discourtesies, little unkindnesses, little \\nforms of disrespect make large withdrawals. In relationships, the little things are the big things. \\nI remember an evening I spent with two of my sons some years ago.  It was an organized \\nfather-and-son outing, complete with gymnastics, wr estling matches, hot dogs, orangeade, and a movie \\n-- the works. \\nIn the middle of the movie, Se an, who was then four years old, fe ll asleep in his seat. His older \\nbrother, Stephen, who was six, stayed awake, and we watched the rest of the movie together. When it \\nwas over, I picked Sean up in my arms, carried him ou t to the car and laid him in the back seat. It was \\nvery cold that night, so I took off my coat  and gently arranged it over and around him. \\nWhen we arrived home, I quickly carried Sean in and tucked him into bed. After Stephen put on \\nhis \"jammies\" and brushed his teeth, I lay down ne xt to him to talk about the night out together. \\n\"How\\'d you like it, Stephen?\" \\n   \"Fine,\" he answere\" \\n   \"Did you have fun?\" \\n   \" Y e s . \"\\n   \"What did you like most?\" \\n   \"I don\\'t know.  The trampoline, I guess.\" \\n\"That was quite a thing, wasn\\'t it -- doing th ose somersaults and tricks in the air like that?\" \\nThere wasn\\'t much response on his part. I found myself making conversation.  I wondered why \\nStephen wouldn\\'t open up more.  He usually did when exciting things happened.  I was a little \\ndisappointed. I sensed something was wrong; he had been so quiet on the way home and getting \\nready for bed. \\nSuddenly Stephen turned over on his side, facing  the wall. I wondered why and lifted myself up \\njust enough to see his eyes welling up with tears. \\n   \"What\\'s wrong, honey?  What is it?\" \\nHe turned back, and I could sense he was feeling some embarrassment for the tears and his \\nquivering lips and chin \\n\"Daddy, if I were cold, would you put your coat around me too?\" \\nOf all the events of that special night out toge ther, the most important was a little act of kindness -- a '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 95}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nmomentary, unconscious showing of love to his little brother. \\nWhat a powerful, personal lesson that experience was to me then and is even now. People are very \\ntender, very sensitive inside. I don\\'t believe age or experience makes much difference. Inside, even \\nwithin the most toughened and calloused exteriors, are the tender feelings and emotions of the heart. \\nKeeping Commitments \\nKeeping a commitment or a promise is a major depo sit; breaking one is a ma jor withdrawal.  In fact, \\nthere\\'s probably not a more massive withdrawal than  to make a promise that\\'s important to someone \\nand then not to come through. The next time a prom ise is made, they won\\'t believe it. People tend to \\nbuild their hopes around promises, particularly promises about their basic livelihood. \\nI\\'ve tried to adopt a philosophy as a parent neve r to make a promise I don\\'t keep. I therefore try to \\nmake them very carefully, very sparingly, and to be  aware of as many variables and contingencies as \\npossible so that something doesn\\'t suddenly come up to keep me from fulfilling it. \\n   Occasionally, despite all my effort, the unexpe cted does come up, creating a situation where it \\nwould be unwise or impossible to keep a promise I\\'ve made. But I value that promise. I either keep it anyway, or explain the situation thoroughly to the person involved and ask to be released from the \\npromise. \\nI believe that if you cultivate the habit of al ways keeping the promises you make, you build bridges \\nof trust that span the gaps of understanding bet ween you and your child. Then, when your child \\nwants to do something you don\\'t want him to do, and out of your maturity you can see consequences that the child cannot see, you can say, \"Son, if you do this, I promise you that this will be the result.\" If that child has cultivated trust in your word, in  your promises, he will act on your counsel. \\nClarifying Expectations \\nImagine the difficulty you might encounter if you and your boss had different assumptions \\nregarding whose role it was to create your job description. \\n\"When am I going to get my job description?\" you might ask. \\n\"I\\'ve been waiting for you to bring one to me so that we could discuss it,\" your boss might reply. \\n\"I thought defining my job was your role.\" \\n\"That\\'s not my role at all. Don\\'t you remember? Right from the first, I said that how you do in the \\njob largely depends on you.\" \\n\"I thought you meant that the quality of my jo b depended on me. But I don\\'t even know what my \\njob really is.\" \\n\"I did exactly what you asked me to do and here is the report.\" \\n\"I don\\'t want a report. The goals was to solve the problem -- not to analyze it and report on it.\" \\n\"I thought the goal was to get a handle on th e problem so we could delegate it to someone else.\" \\nHow many times have we had these kinds of conversations? \\n   \"You said...\" \\n\"No, you\\'re wrong! I said...\" \\n\"You did not! You never said I was supposed to...\" \\n\"Oh, yes I did! I clearly said...\" \\n   \"You never even mentioned...\" \\n\"But that was our agreement...\" \\nThe cause of almost all relationship difficulties is rooted in conflicting or ambiguous expectations \\naround roles and goals. Whether we are dealing with  the question of who does what at work, how \\nyou communicate with your daughter  when you tell her to clean her room, or who feeds the fish and '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 96}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\ntakes out the garbage, we can be certain that unclear expectations will lead to misunderstanding, \\ndisappointment, and withdrawals of trust. \\n   Many expectations are implicit.  They haven\\'t been explicitly stated or announced, but people nevertheless bring them to a particular situation. In marriage, for example, a man and a woman have \\nimplicit expectations of each other in their marriage roles. Although  these expectations have not been \\ndiscussed, or sometimes even recognized by the person who has them, fulfilling them makes great \\ndeposits in the relationship and violating them makes withdrawals. \\n   That\\'s why it\\'s so important wh enever you  come into a new situation to get all the expectations out \\non the table. People will begin to judge each other through those expectations. And if they feel like \\ntheir basic expectations have been violated, the reserve of trust is diminished.  We create many \\nnegative situations by simply assuming that our expectations are self-evident and that they are clearly understood and shared by other people. \\nThe deposit is to make the expectations clear and explicit in the beginning. This takes a real \\ninvestment of time and effort up front, but it save s great amounts of time and effort down the road. \\nWhen expectations are not clear and shared, people begin to become emotionally involved and simple \\nmisunderstandings become compounded, turning into personality clashes and communication \\nbreakdowns. \\nClarifying expectations sometimes takes a great deal of courage. It seems easier to act as though \\ndifferences don\\'t exist and to hope things will work out than it is to face the differences and work \\ntogether to arrive at a mutually agreeable set of expectations. \\nShowing Personal Integrity \\nPersonal integrity generates trust and is th e basis of many different kinds of deposits. \\nLack of integrity can undermine almost any othe r effort to create high trust accounts. People can \\nseek to understand, remember the little things, keep their promises, clarify and fulfill expectations, and \\nstill fail to build reserves of trust if they are inwardly duplicitous. \\nIntegrity includes but goes beyond honesty.  Honesty is telling the truth -- in other words, \\nconforming our words to reality. Integrity is co nforming reality to our words -- in other words, \\nkeeping promises and fulfilling expectations. This requires an integrated character, a oneness, \\nprimarily with self but also with life. \\nOne of the most important ways to manifest integrity is to be loyal to those who are not present. In \\ndoing so, we build the trust of th ose who are present. When you defend those who are absent, you \\nretain the trust of those present. \\nSuppose you and I were talking alone, and we we re criticizing our supervisor in a way that we \\nwould not dare to if he were presen t. Now what will happen when yo u and I have a falling out? You \\nknow I\\'m going to be discussing your weaknesses with someone else. That \\'s what you and I did \\nbehind our supervisor\\'s back. You know my nature . I\\'ll sweet-talk you to your face and bad-mouth \\nyou behind your back. You\\'ve seen me do it. \\n   That\\'s the essence of duplicity.  Does that build a reserve of trust in my account with you. \\nOn the other hand, suppose you were to start cr iticizing our supervisor and I basically told you I \\nagree with the content of some of the criticism and suggest that the two of us go directly to him and \\nmake an effective presentation of how things might be improved . Then what would you know I \\nwould do if someone were to criticize you to me behind your back? \\nFor another example, suppose in my effort to build a relationship with you, I told you something \\nsomeone else had shared with me in confidence. \"I really shouldn\\'t tell you this,\" I might say, \"but \\nsince you\\'re my friend...\" Would my betraying anothe r person build my trust account with you?  Or \\nwould you wonder if the things you had told me in confidence were being shared with others? '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 97}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nSuch duplicity might appear to be making a depo sit with the person you\\'re wi th, but it is actually a \\nwithdrawal because you communicat e your own lack of integrity. You may get the golden egg of \\ntemporary pleasure from putting someone down or sharing privileged information, but you\\'re \\nstrangling the goose, weakening the relationship th at provides enduring pleasure in association. \\nIntegrity in an interdependent reality is simply th is: you treat everyone by the same set of principles. \\nAs you do, people will come to trust you. They ma y not at first appreciate the honest confrontational \\nexperiences such integrity might generate. Conf rontation takes considerable courage, and many \\npeople would prefer to take the course of leas t resistance, belittling an d criticizing, betraying \\nconfidences, or participating in go ssip about others behind their backs. But in the long run, people \\nwill trust and respect you if you are honest and op en and kind with them. You care enough to \\nconfront. And to be trusted, it is said, is greater than  to be loved. In the long run, I am convinced, to \\nbe trusted will be also mean to be loved. \\nWhen my son Joshua was quite young, he woul d frequently ask me a soul-searching question. \\nWhenever I overreacted to someone else or was the le ast bit impatient or unkind, he was so vulnerable \\nand so honest and our relationship was so good that he would simply look me in the eye and say, \"Dad, \\ndo you love me?\" If he thought I was breaking a basic principle of life toward someone else, he \\nwondered if I wouldn\\'t break it with him. \\nAs a teacher, as well as a parent, I have found that the key to the ninety-nin e is the one -- particularly \\nthe one that is testing the patience and the good humo r of the many. It is the love and the discipline of \\nthe one student, the one child, that communicates love  for the others. It\\'s how you treat the one that \\nreveals how you regard the ninety-nine, be cause everyone is ultimately a one. \\nIntegrity also means avoiding any communication  that is deceptive, full of guile, or beneath the \\ndignity of people. \"A lie is any communication with intent to deceive,\" according to one definition of \\nthe word. Whether we communicate with words or be havior, if we have integrity, our intent cannot \\nbe to deceive. \\nApologizing Sincerely When  You Make a Withdrawal \\n   When we make withdrawals fr om the Emotional Bank Account, we need to apologize and we need \\nto do it sincerely. Great deposits come in the sincere words \\n   \"I was wrong.\" \\n   \"That was unkind of me.\" \\n\"I showed you no respect.\" \\n\"I gave you no dignity, and I\\'m deeply sorry.\" \\n\"I embarrassed you in front of your friends and I had no call to do that. Even though I wanted to \\nmake a point, I never should have done it. I apologize.\" \\nIt takes a great deal of character strength to ap ologize quickly out of one\\' s heart rather than out of \\npity. A person must possess himself and have a deep sense of security in fun damental principles and \\nvalues in order to genuinely apologize. \\nPeople with little internal security can\\'t do it. It makes them too vulnerable. They feel it makes \\nthem appear soft and weak, and they fear that othe rs will take advantage of their weakness. Their \\nsecurity is based on the opinions of  other people, and they worry abou t what others might think. In \\naddition, they usually feel justified in what they di d. They rationalize their own wrong in the name of \\nthe other person\\'s wrong, and if they apologize at all, it\\'s superficial. \\n\"If you\\'re going to bow, bow low,\" say Eastern wisdom. \"Pay the uttermost farthing,\" says the \\nChristian ethic. To be a deposit, an apology must be sincere. And it must be perceived as sincere. \\nLeo Roskin taught, \"It is the weak who are cruel. Gentleness can only be expected from the strong.

I could \\nhear the boys running up and down the hall making  loud banging noises, and I could feel my own \\npatience beginning to wane. \\nSuddenly, my son David started pounding on the bathroom door, yelling at the top of his lungs, \"Let \\nme in! Let me in!\" \\nI rushed out of the office and spoke to him with great intensity. \"David, do you have any idea how \\ndisturbing that is to me? Do you know how hard it is to try to concentrate and write creatively? Now \\nyou go into your room and stay in  there until you can behave yourself.\" So in he went, dejected, and \\nshut the door. \\nAs I turned around, I became aware of another problem. The boys had been playing tackle football \\nin the four-foot-wide hallway, and on e of them had been elbowed in th e mouth. He was lying there in \\nthe hall, bleeding from the mouth. David, I discove red, had gone to the bathroom to get a wet towel \\nfor him. But his sister, Maria, who was taking a shower, wouldn\\'t open the door. \\n   When I realized that I ha d completely misinterpreted the situation and had overreacted, I \\nimmediately went in to apologize to David. \\nAs I opened the door, the first thing he said to me was, \"I won\\'t forgive you.\" \\n   \"Well, why not, honey?\" I replied.  \"Honestly, I didn\\'t realize you were trying to help your brother. \\nWhy won\\'t you forgive me?\" \\n\"Because you did the same thing last week,\" he replied. In other words, he was saying. \"Dad, \\nyou\\'re overdrawn, and you\\'re not going to talk your way out of a problem you behaved yourself into.\" \\nSincere apologies make deposits; repeated apologies interpreted as insincere make withdrawals. \\nAnd the quality of the relationship reflects it. \\nIt is one thing to make a mistake, and quit e another thing not to admit it. People will forgive \\nmistakes, because mistakes are usually of the mind, mistakes of judgment.  Bu t people will not easily \\nforgive the mistakes of the heart, the ill intention, th e bad motives, the prideful justifying cover-up of \\nthe first mistake. \\nThe Laws of Love and the Laws of Life \\nWhen we make deposits of unconditional love, when we live the primary laws of love, we \\nencourage others to live the primary  laws of life. In other words, when we truly love others without \\ncondition, without strings, we help them feel secure and safe and validated and affirmed in their \\nessential worth, identity, and integrity. Their na tural growth process is encouraged. We make it \\neasier for them to live the laws of life -- cooperatio n, contribution, self-discipline, integrity -- and to \\ndiscover and live true to the highest and best within them. We give them the freedom to act on their \\nown inner imperatives rather than react to our cond itions and limitations. This does not mean we \\nbecome permissive or soft. That itself is a massi ve withdrawal. We counsel, we plead, we set limits \\nand consequences. But we love, regardless. \\nWhen we violate the primary laws of love -- when we attach strings and condit ions to that gift -- we \\nactually encourage others to violate the primary laws of life. We put them in a reactive, defensive \\nposition where they feel they have to prove \"I matter as a person, independent of you.\" \\nIn reality, they aren\\'t independent. They  are counter-dependent, wh ich is another form of \\ndependency and is at the lowest end of the Matu rity Continuum.  They become reactive, almost \\nenemy-centered, more concerned about defending their \"rights\" and producing evidence of their \\nindividuality than they are about proactively liste ning to and honoring th eir own inner imperatives. \\nRebellion is a knot of the heart, not of the mind. The key is to make deposits -- constant deposits of \\nunconditional love.

He planned and saved for years to \\nprovide his son the opportunity to attend that instit ution, but when the time came, the boy refused to \\ngo. \\n   This deeply concerned his father.  Graduating from that particular school would have been a great \\nasset to the boy. Besides, it was a family tradition. Three generations of attendance preceded the boy. \\nThe father pleaded and urged and talked. He also trie d to listen to the boy to understand him, all the \\nwhile hoping that the so n would change his mind. \\nThe subtle message being communicated was one of  conditional love. The son felt that in a sense \\nthe father\\'s desire for him to attend the school outweighed the value he placed on him as a person and \\nas a son, which was terribly threatening. Conseque ntly, he fought for and with his own identity and \\nintegrity, and he increased his resolve and his efforts to rationalize his decision not to go. \\nAfter some intense soul-searching, the father de cided to make a sacrifice -- to renounce conditional \\nlove. He knew that his son might choose differently than he had wished; nevertheless, he and his wife \\nresolved to love their son unconditionally, regardless of his choice. It was an extremely difficult thing \\nto do because the value of his educational experien ce was so close to their hearts and because it was \\nsomething they had planned and worked for since his birth. \\nThe father and mother went through a very difficult rescriptin g process, struggling to really \\nunderstand the nature of unconditional love. Th ey communicated to the boy what they were doing \\nand why, and told him that they had come to the po int at which they could sa y in all honesty that his \\ndecision would not affect their complete feeling of un conditional love toward him. They didn\\'t do this \\nto manipulate him, to try to get him to \"shape up.\" They did it as the logical extension of their growth \\nand character. \\n   The boy didn\\'t give much of  a response at the time, but his parents had such a paradigm of \\nunconditional love at that point that it would have made no difference in their feelings for him. About \\na week later, he told his parents th at he had decided not to go. They were perfectly prepared for his \\nresponse and continued to show unconditional lo ve for him. Everything was settled and life went \\nalong normally. \\nA short time later, an interesting thing happened. Now that the boy no longer felt he had to defend \\nhis position, he searched within himself more deeply and found that he really did want to have this \\neducational experience. He applied for admission, and then he told his fa ther, who again showed \\nunconditional love by fully accepting his son\\'s deci sion. My friend was happy, but not excessively so, \\nbecause he had truly learned to love without condition. \\nDag Hammarskjold, past Secretary-General of  the United Nations, once made a profound, \\nfar-reaching statement: \"It is more noble to give yourself completely to one individual than to labor \\ndiligently for the salvation of the masses.\" \\nI take that to mean that I could devote eight, te n, or twelve hours a day, five, six, or seven days a \\nweek to the thousands of people and projects \"o ut there\" and still not have a deep, meaningful \\nrelationship with my own spouse, with my own teenage son, with my closest working associate. And \\nit would take more nobility of character -- more hum ility, courage, and strength -- to rebuild that one \\nrelationship than it would to continue putting in all those hours for all those people and causes. \\nIn 25 years of consulting with organizations, I have been impressed over and over again by the \\npower of that statement. Many of the problems in organizations stem from relationship difficulties at \\nthe very top -- between two partners in a comp any, between the president and an executive \\nvice-president. It truly takes more nobility of charac ter to confront and resolve those issues than it \\ndoes to continue to diligently work for the many projects and people \"out there.\" \\nWhen I first came across Hammarskjold\\'s statem ent, I was working in an organization where there \\nwere unclear expectations between the individual wh o was my right-hand man and myself. I simply \\ndid not have the courage to confro nt our differences regarding role and goal expectations and values, '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 100}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nparticularly in our methods of administration. So I worked for a number of months in a compromise \\nmode to avoid what might turn out to be an ugly  confrontation. All the while, bad feelings were \\ndeveloping inside both of us. \\nAfter reading that it is more noble to give yo urself completely to one individual than to labor \\ndiligently for the salvation of the masses, I was d eeply affected by the idea of rebuilding that \\nrelationship. \\nI had to steel myself for what lay ahead, because I knew it would be hard to really get the issues out \\nand to achieve a deep, common understanding and commitment. I remember actually shaking in \\nanticipation of the visit. He seemed like such a hard man, so set in his own ways and so right in his \\nown eyes; yet I needed his strengths and abilities. I was afraid a confrontation might jeopardize the relationship and result in my losing those strengths. \\nI went through a mental dress rehearsal of the an ticipated visit, and I finally became settled within \\nmyself around the principles rather than  the practices of what I was going to do and say. At last I felt \\npeace of mind and the courag e to have the communication. \\nWhen we met together, to my total surprise, I di scovered that this man had been going through the \\nvery same process and had been longing for such  a conversation. He was anything but hard and \\ndefensive. \\nNevertheless, our administrative styles were co nsiderably different, and th e entire organization was \\nresponding to these differences. We both acknowle dged the problems that our disunity had created. \\nOver several visits, we were able to confront the deeper  issues, to get them all out on the table, and to \\nresolve them, one by one, with a spirit of high mu tual respect. We were able to develop a powerful \\ncomplementary team and a deep personal affection which added tremendously to our ability to work \\neffectively together. \\nCreating the unity necessary to run an effective business or a family or a marriage requires great \\npersonal strength and courage. No amount of tec hnical administrative skill in laboring for the masses \\ncan make up for lack of nobility of personal characte r in developing relationships. It is at a very \\nessential, one-on-one level, that we liv e the primary laws of love and life. \\nP Problems are PC Opportunities \\nThis experience also taught me another powerful  paradigm of interdependence. It deals with the \\nway in which we see problems. I had lived for months  t r y i n g  t o  a v o i d  t h e  p r o b l e m ,  s e e i n g  i t  a s  a \\nsource of irritation, a stumbling block, and wishing it  would somehow go away. But, as it turned out, \\nthe very problem created the opportunity to build a deep relationship that empowered us to work \\ntogether as a strong complementary team. \\nI suggest that in an interdependent situation,  every P problem is a PC opportunity -- a chance to \\nbuild the Emotional Bank Accounts that sign ificantly affect interdependent production. \\nWhen parents see their children\\'s problems as op portunities to build the relationship instead of as \\nnegative, burdensome irritations, it totally changes the nature of  parent-child interaction.  Parents \\nbecome more willing, even excited, about deeply understanding and helping their children. When a \\nchild comes to them with a problem, instead of  thinking, \"Oh, no! Not another problem!\" their \\nparadigm is, \"Here is a great opportunity for me to really help my child and to invest in our \\nrelationship.\" Many interactions change from tran sactional to transformational, and strong bonds of \\nlove and trust are created as children sense the valu e parents give to their problems and to them as \\nindividuals. \\nThis paradigm is powerful in business as well. One department store chain that operates from this \\nparadigm has created a great loyalty among its custom ers. Any time a customer comes into the store \\nwith a problem, not matter how small, the clerks immediately see it as an opportunity to build the '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 101}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nrelationship with the customer. Th ey respond with a cheerful , positive desire to solve the problem in a \\nway that will make the customer happy. They treat the customer with such grace and respect, giving \\nsuch second-mile service, that many of the cust omers don\\'t even think of going anywhere else. \\nBy recognizing that the P/PC Balance is necessary  to effectiveness in an interdependent reality, we \\ncan value our problems as opportunities to increase PC. \\nThe Habits of Interdependence \\nWith the paradigm of the Emotional Bank Account in mind, we\\'re ready to move into the habits of \\nPublic Victory, or success in working with other people. As we do, we can see how these habits work \\ntogether to create effective interdependence. We  can also see how powerfully scripted we are in other \\npatterns of thought and behavior. \\nIn addition, we can see on an even deeper level that effective in terdependence can only be achieved \\nby truly independent people.  It is impossible to  achieve Public Victory with popular \"Win-Win \\nnegotiation\" techniques of \"reflect ive listening\" techniques or \"creativ e problem-solving\" techniques that \\nfocus on personality and truncate the vital character base. \\nLet\\'s now focus on each of the Public Victory habits in depth. \\nHabit 4: Think Win-Win TM -- Princi ples of Interpersonal Leadership \\nWe have committed the Golden Rule to  memory; let us now commit it to life. \\n   -- Edwin Markha \\n*  * \\nOne time I was asked to work with a company whose president was very concerned about the lack \\nof cooperation among his people. \\n\"Our basic problem, Stephen, is that they\\'re selfis h,\" he said. \"They just won\\'t cooperate. I know if \\nthey would cooperate, we could produce so much mo re. Can you help us develop a human-relations \\nprogram that will solve the problem?\" \\n\"Is your problem the people or the paradigm?\" I asked. \\n\"Look for yourself,\" he replied. \\nSo I did. And I found that there was a real se lfishness, and unwillingness to cooperate, a resistance \\nto authority, defensive communication. I could see that overdrawn Emotional Bank Accounts had \\ncreated a culture of low trust. But I pressed the question. \\n\"Let\\'s look at it deeper,\" I suggested. \"Why don\\'t your people cooperate? What is the reward for \\nnot cooperating?\" \\n\"There\\'s no reward for not cooperating,\" he assured me. \"The rewards are much greater if they do \\ncooperate. \\n\"Are they?\" I asked. Behind a curtain on one wall of this man\\'s office was a chart. On the chart \\nwere a number of racehorses all lined up on a track. Superimposed on  the face of each horse was the \\nface of one of his managers. At the end of the trac k was a beautiful travel poster of Bermuda, an idyllic \\npicture of blue skies and fleecy clouds and a roma ntic couple walking hand in hand down a white \\nsandy beach. \\nOnce a week, this man would brin g all his people into this office and talk cooperation. \"Let\\'s all \\nwork together. We\\'ll all make more money if we do .\" Then he would pull th e curtain and show them \\nthe chart. \"Now which of you is going to win the trip to Bermuda?\" \\nIt was like telling one flower to grow and wateri ng another, like saying \"fir ings will continue until \\nmorale improves.\"  He wanted cooperation.  He wanted  his people to work together, to share ideas, to '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 102}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nall benefit from the effort. But he was setting them up in competition with each other.  One \\nmanager\\'s success meant failure for the other managers \\nAs with many, many problems between people in business, family, and other relationships, the \\nproblem in this company was the result of a flawed  paradigm. The president was trying to get the \\nfruits of cooperation from a paradigm of competit ion.  And when it didn\\'t work, he wanted a \\ntechnique, a program, a quick-fix antidote to make his people cooperate. \\nBut you can\\'t change the fruit without changing  the root. Working on th e attitudes and behaviors \\nwould have been hacking at the leaves.  So we focused instead on producing personal and \\norganizational excellence in an entirely different way by developing information and reward systems \\nwhich reinforced the value of cooperation. \\nWhether you are the president of a company or the janitor, the moment you step from independence \\ninto interdependence in any capacity, you step into  a leadership role.  You are in a position of \\ninfluencing other people. And the habit of effect ive interpersonal leadership is Think Win-Win. \\nSix Paradigms of Human Interaction \\nWin-win is not a technique; it \\'s a total philosophy of human interaction. In fact, it is one of six \\nparadigms of interaction.  The alternative paradig ms are win-lose, lose-win, lose-lose, win, and \\nWin-Win or No Deal TM \\nWin-Win \\nWin-win is a frame of mind and heart that consta ntly seeks mutual benefit in all human interactions. \\nWin-win means that agreements or solutions are mu tually beneficial, mutually satisfying. With a \\nwin-win solution, all parties feel good about the de cision and feel committed to the action plan. \\nWin-win sees life as a cooperative, not a competitiv e arena. Most people tend to think in terms of \\ndichotomies: strong or weak, hardball or softball,  w i n  o r  l o s e .   B u t  t h a t  k i n d  o f  t h i n k i n g  i f \\nfundamentally flawed. It\\'s based on power and position rather than on princi ple.  Win-win is based \\non the paradigm that there is plenty for everybody, that one person\\'s success is not achieved at the \\nexpense or exclusion of the success of others. \\nWin-win is a belief in the Third Alternative. It\\'s  not your way or my way; it\\'s a better way, a higher \\nway. \\nWin-Lose \\nOne alternative to win-win is win-lose, the paradig m of the race to Bermuda. It says \"If I win, you \\nlose. \\nIn leadership style, win-lose is the authoritari an approach: \"I get my way; you don\\'t get yours.\" \\nWin-lose people are prone to use position, power, credentials, possessions, or personality to get their \\nway. \\nMost people have been deeply scripted in the win-lose mentality since birth. First and most \\nimportant of the powerful forces at work is the family. When one child is  compared with another -- \\nwhen patience, understanding or love is given or withdrawn on the basis of such comparisons -- people \\nare into win-lose thinking. Whenever love is given on a conditional basis, when someone has to earn love, what\\'s being communicated to them is that they  are not intrinsically valuable or lovable. Value \\ndoes not lie inside them, it lies outside. It\\'s in comparison with somebody else or against some \\nexpectation. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 103}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nAnd what happens to a youn g mind and heart, highly vulnerab le, highly dependent upon the \\nsupport and emotional affirmation of the parents, in the face of conditional love? The child is molded, \\nshaped, and programmed in the win-lose mentality. \\n\"If I\\'m better than my brother, my parents will love me more.\" \\n\"My parents don\\'t love me as  much as they love my sister. I must not be as valuable.\"\\n   Another powerful scripting agen cy is the peer group. A child first wants acceptance from his \\nparents and then from his peers, whether they be siblings or friends. And we all know how cruel \\npeers sometimes can be. They often accept or reje ct totally on the basis of conformity to their \\nexpectations and norms, providing additional scripting toward win-lose. \\nThe academic world reinforces win-lose scripting . The \"normal distribution curve\" basically says \\nthat you got an \"A\" because someone else got a \"C.\" It interprets an indivi dual\\'s value by comparing \\nhim or her to everyone else. No recognition is gi ven to intrinsic value; everyone is extrinsically \\ndefined. \\n\"Oh, how nice to see you here at our PTA meeting. You ought to be really proud of your daughter, \\nCaroline. She\\'s in the upper 10 percent.\" \\n\"That makes me feel good.\" \\n\"But your son, Johnny, is in trouble. He\\'s in the lower quartile.\" \\n\"Really? Oh, that\\'s terrible! What can we do about it?\" \\nWhat this kind of comparative information does n\\'t tell you is that perhaps Johnny is going on all \\neight cylinders while Caroline is coas ting on four of her eight. But people are not graded against their \\npotential or against the full use of their present capaci ty. They are graded in relation to other people. \\nAnd grades are carriers of social value; they op en doors of opportunity or they close them. \\nCompetition, not cooperation, lies at the core of the educational process.  Cooperation, in fact, is \\nusually associated with cheating. \\n   Another powerful programming ag ent is athletics, particularly for young men in their high school or \\ncollege years. Often they develop the basic paradigm that life is a big game , a zero sum game where \\nsome win and some lose. \"Winning\" is \"beating\" in the athletic arena. \\nAnother agent is law. We live in a litigious so ciety. The first thing many people think about when \\nthey get into trouble is suing someone, taking him to  court, \"winning\" at someone else\\'s expense. But \\ndefensive minds are neither creative nor cooperative. \\nCertainly we need law or else society will deterio rate. It provides survival, but it doesn\\'t create \\nsynergy. At best it results in compromise. Law is  based on an adversarial concept. The recent trend \\nof encouraging lawyers and law schools to focus on pe aceable negotiation, the techniques of win-win, \\nand the use of private courts, may not provide the ultimate solution, but it does reflect a growing \\nawareness of the problem. \\nCertainly there is a place for win-lose thinking  in truly competitive and low-trust situations. But \\nmost of life is not a competition. We don\\'t have  to live each day compet ing with our spouse, our \\nchildren, our co-workers, our neighbors, and our fr iends. \"Who\\'s winning in your marriage?\" is a \\nridiculous question. If both people aren\\'t winning, both are losing. \\nMost of life is an interdependent, not an indepe ndent, reality. Most results you want depend on \\ncooperation between you and others. And the win-lose  mentality is dysfunctional to that cooperation. \\nLose-Win \\n   Some people are programmed the other way -- lose-win. \\n   \"I lose, you win.\" \\n   \"Go ahead.  Have your way with me.\" \\n   \"Step on me again.  Everyone does.\" '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 104}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t\\n   \"I\\'m a loser.  I\\'ve always been a loser.\" \\n   \"I\\'m a peacemaker.  I\\'ll do anything to keep peace.\" \\nLose-win is worse than win-lose because it ha s no standards -- no demands, no expectations, no \\nvision. People who think lose-win are usually quick to  please or appease. They seek strength from \\npopularity or acceptance. They have little courage to express their own feelings and convictions and \\nare easily intimidated by th e ego strength of others. \\nIn negotiation, lose-win is seen as capitulation - -  g i v i n g  i n  o r  g i v i n g  u p . I n  l e a d e r s h i p  s t y l e ,  i t \\' s \\npermissiveness or indulgence. Lose-win means bein g a nice guy, even if \"nice guys finish last. \\nWin-lose people love lose-win people because they can feed on them. They love their weaknesses \\n-- they take advantage of them. Such weaknesses complement their strengths. \\nBut the problem is that lose-win people bury a lot of feelings. And unexpressed feelings never die; \\nthey\\'re buried alive and come fo rth in uglier ways.  Psychosomatic illnesses, particularly of the \\nrespiratory, nervous, and circulatory systems ofte n are the reincarnation of cumulative resentment, \\ndeep disappointment, and disillusionment repressed by  the lose-win mentality. Disproportionate rage \\nor anger, overreaction to minor provocation, an d cynicism are other embodiments of suppressed \\nemotion. \\nPeople who are constantly repressing, not transcending, feelings towards a higher meaning find that \\nit affects the quality of their self-esteem and eventu ally the quality of their relationships with others. \\nBoth win-lose and lose-win are weak positions, based in personal insecurities. In the short run, \\nwin-lose will produce more results because it draws on the often considerable strengths and talents of \\nthe people at the top. Lose-win is weak and chaotic from the outset. \\nMany executives, managers, and parents swing back  and forth, as if on a pendulum, from win-lose \\ninconsideration to lose-win indulg ence.  When they can\\'t stand co nfusion and lack of structure, \\ndirection, expectation, and discipline any longer, they  swing back to win-lose -- until guilt undermines \\ntheir resolve and drives them back to lose-win -- until anger and frust ration drive them back to win-lose \\nagain. \\nLose-Lose \\nWhen two win-lose people get together -- that  is, when two determined , stubborn, ego-invested \\nindividuals interact -- the result will be lose-lose. Both will lose. Both will become vindictive and \\nwant to \"get back\" or \"get even,\" blind to the fact that murder is suicide, that revenge is a two-edged \\nsword. \\nI know of a divorce in which the husband was dire cted by the judge to sell the assets and turn over \\nhalf the proceeds to his ex-wife. In compliance, he sold a car worth over $10,000 for $50 and gave $25 \\nto the wife. When the wife protested, the court cl erk checked on the situation and discovered that the \\nhusband was proceeding in the same manner sy stematically through all of the assets. \\nSome people become so centered on an enemy,  so totally obsessed with the behavior of another \\nperson that they become blind to everything except thei r desire for that person to  lose, even if it means \\nlosing themselves. Lose-lose is the philosophy  of adversarial conflict, the philosophy of war. \\nLose-lose is also the philosophy of the highly  dependent person without inner direction who is \\nmiserable and thinks everyone else should be, too. \"If nobody ever wins, perh aps being a loser isn\\'t so \\nbad. \\nWin \\nAnother common alternative is simply to th ink win.  People with the win mentality don\\'t \\nnecessarily want someone else to lose. That\\'s irre levant. What matters is that they get what they '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 105}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nwant. \\nWhen there is no sense of contest or competit ion, win is probably the most common approach in \\neveryday negotiation. A person with the win menta lity thinks in terms of securing his own ends -- \\nand leaving it to others to secure theirs. \\nWhich Option Is Best? \\nOf these five philosophies discussed so far -- win-win, win-lose, lose-win, lose-lose, and win -\\xad\\nwhich is the most effective? The answer is, \"It depends.\" If you win a football game, that means the \\nother team loses. If you work in a regional office that is miles away from another regional office, and \\nyou don\\'t have any functional relationship between th e offices, you may want to compete in a win-lose \\nsituation to stimulate business. However, you would not want to set up a win-lose situation like the \\n\"Race to Bermuda\" contest within a company or in a situation where you need cooperation among \\npeople or groups of people to achieve maximum success. \\nIf you value a relationship and the issue isn\\'t rea lly that important, you may want to go for lose-win \\nin some circumstances to genuinely affirm the other person. \"What I want isn\\'t as important to me as \\nmy relationship with you. Let\\'s do it your way this  time.\" You might also go for lose-win if you feel \\nthe expense of time and effort to achieve a win of any kind would violate other higher values. Maybe \\nit just isn\\'t worth it. \\nThere are circumstances in which you would want to win, and you wouldn \\'t be highly concerned \\nwith the relationship of that win to others. If yo ur child\\'s life were in danger, for example, you might \\nbe peripherally concerned about other people and circumstances.  But saving that life would be \\nsupremely important. \\nThe best choice, then, depends on reality. The ch allenge is to read that reality accurately and not to \\ntranslate win-lose or other scripting into every situation. \\nMost situations, in fact, are part of an interdependent reality, and then wi n-win is really the only \\nviable alternative of the five. \\nWin-lose is not viable because, although I appe ar to win in a confrontation with you, your feelings, \\nyour attitudes toward me and our relationship have been affected. If I am a supplier to your company, for example, and I win on my terms in a particular negotiation, I may get what I want now. But will \\nyou come to me again? My short-term win will real ly be a long-term lose if I don\\'t get your repeat \\nbusiness. So an interdependent win-lose  is really lose-lose in the long run. \\nIf we come up with a lose-win, you may appear to get what you want for the moment. But how \\nwill that affect my attitude about working with you,  about fulfilling the contrac t? I may not feel as \\nanxious to please you. I may carry battle scars with me into any future negotiations. My attitude about you and your company may be spread as I associ ate with others in the in dustry.  So we\\'re into \\nlose-lose again.  Lose-lose obviously isn\\'t viable in any context. \\nAnd if I focus on my own win and don\\'t even co nsider your point of view,  there\\'s no basis for any \\nkind of productive relationship. \\nIn the long run, if it isn\\'t a win for both of us , we both lose. That\\'s why win-win is the only real \\nalternative in interdependent realities. \\nI worked with a client once, the president of a large chain of retail stores, who said, \"Stephen, this \\nwin-win idea sounds good, but it is so idealistic. The tough, realistic business world isn\\'t like that. \\nThere\\'s win-lose everywhere, and if you\\'re not out there playing the game, you just can\\'t make it.\" \\n\"All right,\" I said, \"try going for win-lose  with your customers.

Is that realistic?\" \\n\"No. No margin, no mission.\" \\nAs we considered the various alternatives, win-win appeared to be the only truly realistic approach. \\n\"I guess that\\'s true with customers, \" he admitted, \"but not with suppliers.\" \\n\"You are the customer of the supplier,\" I said. \"Why doesn\\'t the same principle apply?\" \\n\"Well, we recently renegotiated our lease agreem ents with the mall operators and owners,\" he said. \\n\"We went in with a win-win attitude. We were op en, reasonable, conciliatory. But they saw that \\nposition as being soft and weak, an d they took us to the cleaners.\" \\n\"Well, why did you go for lose-win?\" I asked. \\n   \"We didn\\'t.  We went for win-win.\" \\n\"I thought you said they  took you to the cleaners.\" \\n   \"They did.\" \\n\"In other words, you lost.\" \\n   \"That\\'s right.\" \\n   \"And they won.\" \\n   \"That\\'s right.\" \\n   \"So what\\'s that called?\" \\nWhen he realized that what he had called wi n-win was really lose-win, he was shocked. And as \\nwe examined the long-term impact of that lose-win, the suppressed f eelings, the trampled values, the \\nresentment that seethed under the surface of the relati onship, we agreed that it was really a loss for both \\nparties in the end. \\nIf this man had had a real win-win attitude, he would have stayed longer in the communication \\nprocess, listened to the mall owner more, then expre ssed his point of view with more courage. He \\nwould have continued in the win-win spirit until a so lution was reached and they both felt good about \\nit. And that solution, that Third Alternative, would have b een synergistic -- probably something \\nneither of them had thought of on his own. \\nWin-Win or No Deal TM \\nIf these individuals had not come up with a syne rgistic solution -- one that  was agreeable to both -- \\nthey could have gone for an even higher ex pression of win-win, Win-Win or No Deal. \\nNo deal basically means that if we can\\'t find a solution that would benefit us both, we agree to \\ndisagree agreeably -- no deal.  No expectations have been created, no performance contracts \\nestablished. I don\\'t hire you or we don\\'t take on a particular assignment together because it\\'s obvious \\nthat our values or our goals are going in opposite di rections. It is so much better to realize this up \\nfront instead of downstream when expectations have been created and both parties have been \\ndisillusioned. \\nWhen you have no deal as an option in your mind, you feel liberated beca use you have no need to \\nmanipulate people, to push your own agenda, to drive for what you want.  You can be open.  You can \\nreally try to understand the deeper issues underlying the positions. \\nWith no deal as an option, you can honestly say, \"I only want to go for win-win. I want to win, and \\nI want you to win. I wouldn\\'t want to get my way and have you not feel good about it, because \\ndownstream it would eventually surface and create  a withdrawal. On the other hand, I don\\'t think \\nyou would feel good if you got your way and I gave in. So let\\'s work for a win-win. Let\\'s really \\nhammer it out. And if we can\\'t find it, then let\\'s agree that we won\\'t make a deal at all. It would be \\nbetter not to deal than to live with a decision that wasn\\'t right for us both. Then maybe another time \\nwe might be able to get together.\" '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 107}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nSome time after learning the concept of Win-Win or No Deal, th e president of a small computer \\nsoftware company shared with me the following experience: \\n\"We had developed new software which we sold on a five-year contract to a particular bank. The \\nbank president was excited about it, but his people weren\\'t really behind the decision. \\n\"About a month later, that bank changed presidents.  The new presid ent came to me and said, \\'I am \\nuncomfortable with these software conversions. I have a mess on my hands. My people are all \\nsaying that they can\\'t go through this and I really feel I just can\\'t push it at this point in time.\\' \\n\"My own company was in deep financial trouble. I knew I had every legal right to enforce the \\ncontract. But I had become convinced of the value of the principle of win-win. \\n\"So I told him \\'We have a contract. Your bank has secured our products and our services to convert \\nyou to this program. But we understand that you\\'re not happy about it. So what we\\'d like to do is \\ngive you back the contract, give you back your deposit, and if you are ever looking for a software \\nsolution in the future, come back and see us.\\' \\n\"I literally walked away from an $84,000 contract. It was close to financial suicide. But I felt that, \\nin the long run, if the principle were tr ue, it would come back and pay dividends. \\n\"Three months later, the new president called me . \\'I\\'m now going to make changes in my date \\nprocessing,\\' he said, \\'and I want to do busi ness with you.\\' He signed a contract for $240,000.\" \\nAnything less than win-win in an  interdependent reality is a poor second best that will have impact \\nin the long-term relationship. The cost of the impact needs to be carefully considered. If you can\\'t \\nreach a true win-win, you\\'re very often better off to go for no deal. \\nWin-Win or No Deal provides tremendous emotio nal freedom in the family relationship. If family \\nmembers can\\'t agree on a video that everyone will enjoy, they can simply decide to do something else -- no deal -- rather than having some enjo y the evening at the expense of others. \\nI have a friend whose family has been involved  in singing together for several years. When they \\nwere young, she arranged the music, made the costumes, accompanied th em on the piano, and directed \\nthe performances. \\nAs the children grew older, their taste in music be gan to change and they wanted to have more say \\nin what they performed and what they wore. They became less responsive to direction. \\nBecause she had years of experience in performing  herself and felt closer to the needs of the older \\npeople at the rest homes where they planned to perf orm, she didn\\'t feel that  many of the ideas they \\nwere suggesting would be appropriate. At the sa me time, however, she recognized their need to \\nexpress themselves and to be part of the decision-making process. \\nSo she set up a Win-Win or No Deal. She told  them she wanted to arrive at an agreement that \\neveryone felt good about -- or they would simply fi nd other ways to enjoy their talents. As a result, \\neveryone felt free to express his or her feelings  and ideas as they worked to set up a Win-Win \\nAgreement, knowing that whether or not they could agree, there would be no emotional strings. \\nThe Win-Win or No Deal approach is most realis tic at the beginning of a business relationship or \\nenterprise. In a continuing business relationship, no deal may not be a viable option, which can create serious problems, especially for family businesses or businesses that are begun initially on the basis of \\nfriendship. \\nIn an effort to preserve the relationship, people sometimes go on for years making one compromise \\nafter another, thinking win-lose or lose-win even wh ile talking win-win. This creates serious problems \\nfor the people and for the business, particularly if the competition operates on win-win and synergy. \\nWithout no deal, many such businesses simply dete riorate and either fail or have to be turned over \\nto professional managers. Experience shows that it is often better in setting up a family business or a \\nbusiness between friends to acknowle dge the possibility of no deal downstream and to establish some \\nkind of buy/sell agreement so that the business can prosper without permanently damaging the \\nrelationship.

I wouldn\\'t abandon my child or \\nmy spouse and go for no deal (it would be better, if  necessary, to go for compromise -- a low form of \\nwin-win). But in many cases, it is possible to go  into negotiation with a full Win-Win or No Deal \\nattitude. And the freedom in the attitude is incredible. \\nFive Dimensions of Win-Win \\nThink Win-Win is the habit of interpersonal lead ership. It involves the exercise of each of the \\nunique human endowments -- self-awareness, imaginat ion, conscience, and independent will -- in our \\nrelationships with others. It involves mutual  learning, mutual influence, mutual benefits. \\nIt takes great courage as well as consideration to  create these mutual bene fits, particularly if we\\'re \\ninteracting with others who are deeply scripted in win-los. \\nThat is why this habit involves principles of  interpersonal leadership.  Effective interpersonal \\nleadership requires the vision, the proactive initia tive, and the security, guidance, wisdom, and power \\nthat come from principle-ce ntered personal leadership. \\nThe principle of win-win is fundamental to success in all our interactions, and it embraces five \\ninterdependent dimensions of life. It begins wi th character and moves toward relationships, out of \\nwhich flow agreements. It is nurtured in an en vironment where structure and systems are based on \\nwin-win. And it involves process; we cannot achiev e win-win ends with win-lose or lose-win means. \\nThe following diagram shows how these five dimensions relate to each other. \\nNow let\\'s consider each of the five dimensions in turn. \\nCharacter \\nCharacter is the foundation of win-win, and everything else builds on that foundation. There are \\nthree character traits essential to the win-win paradigm. \\nINTEGRITY. We\\'ve already defined integrity as the value we place on ourselves. Habits 1, 2, and \\n3 help us develop and maintain integrity. As we cl early identify our values and proactively organize \\nand execute around those values on a daily basis, we develop self-awareness and independent will by \\nmaking and keeping meaningful promises and commitments. \\nThere\\'s no way to go for a win in our own liv es if we don\\'t even know, in a deep sense, what \\nconstitutes a win -- what is, in fact, harmonious wi th our innermost values. And if we can\\'t make and \\nkeep commitments to ourselves as well as to others , our commitments become meaningless. We know \\nit; others know it. They sense duplicity and become guarded. There\\'s no foundation of trust and \\nwin-win becomes an ineffective superficial technique. Integrity is the cornerstone in the foundation. \\nMATURITY. Maturity is the balance between cou rage and consideration. If a person can express \\nhis feelings and convictions with courage balanced with consideration for the feelings and convictions \\nof another person, he is mature , particularly if the issue is ve ry important to both parties. \\nIf you examine many of the psychological tests used for hiring, promoting, and training purposes, \\nyou will find that they are designed to evaluate th is kind of maturity. Whether it\\'s called the ego \\nstrength/empathy balance, the self confidence/respect for others balance, the concern for people/concern for tasks balance, \"I\\'m okay, you\\'re okay\" in transact ional analysis language, or 9.1, 1.9, \\n5.5, 9.9, in management grid language -- the quality soug ht for is the balance of what I call courage and \\nconsideration. \\nRespect for this quality is deeply ingrained in the theory of human in teraction, management, and \\nleadership. It is a deep embodiment of the P/PC Balance. While courage may focus on getting the \\ngolden egg, consideration deals with the long-term we lfare of the other stakeholders. The basic task of \\nleadership is to increase the standard of living and the quali ty of life for all stakeholders.

They think if you\\'re nice, you\\'re not tough. \\nBut win-win is nice...and tough. It\\'s twice as tough as win-lose. To go for win-win, you not only have \\nto be nice, you have to be courageous. You not only  have to be empathic, you have to be confident. \\nYou not only have to be considerate and sensitive, yo u have to be brave. To do that, to achieve that \\nbalance between courage and consideration, is the essence of real maturity and is fundamental to \\nwin-win. \\nIf I\\'m high on courage and low on consideratio n, how will I think? Win-lose. I\\'ll be strong and \\nego bound. I\\'ll have the courage of my convictions, but I won\\'t be very considerate of yours. \\nTo compensate for my lack of internal maturity and emotional strength, I might borrow strength \\nfrom my position and power, or from my cr edentials, my seniority, my affiliation. \\nIf I\\'m high on consideration and low on courage,  I\\'ll think lose-win. I\\'ll be so considerate of your \\nconvictions and desires that I won\\'t have th e courage to express and actualize my own. \\nHigh courage and consideration are both essential to win-win. It is the balance that is the mark of \\nreal maturity. If I have it, I ca n listen, I can empathically unders tand, but I can also courageously \\nconfront. \\n   ABUNDANCE MENTALITY TM.  The third characte r trait essential to win-win is the Abundance \\nMentality, the paradigm that there is plenty out there for everybody. \\nMost people are deeply scripted in what I call the Scarcity Mentality. They see life as having only \\nso much, as though there were only one pie out ther e. And if someone were to get a big piece of the \\npie, it would mean less for everybody else. The Scarcity Mentality is the zero-sum paradigm of life. \\nPeople with a Scarcity Mentality have a very diffi cult time sharing recognition and credit, power or \\nprofit -- even with those who help in the production. They also have a very hard time being genuinely \\nhappy for the successes of other people -- even, and sometimes especially, members of their own family \\nor close friends and associates. It\\'s almost as if  something is being taken from them when someone \\nelse receives special recognition or windfall gain or has remarkable success or achievement. \\nAlthough they might verbally express happiness for others\\' success, inwardly they are eating their \\nhearts out. Their sense of worth comes from being compared, and someone else\\'s success, to some \\ndegree, means their failure. Only so many people  can be \"A\" students; only one person can be \\n\"number one.\" To \"win\" simply means to \"beat.\" \\nOften, people with a Scarcity Mentality harbor secret hopes that others might suffer misfortune -- \\nnot terrible misfortune, but acceptable misfortune that would keep them \"in their place.\" They\\'re always comparing, always competing. They give their energies to possessing things or other people in \\norder to increase their sense of worth. \\nThey want other people to be the way they want them to be. They often want to clone them, and \\nthey surround themselves with \"yes\" people -- pe ople who won\\'t challenge them, people who are \\nweaker than they. \\nIt\\'s difficult for people with a Scarcity Menta lity to be members of a complementary team. They \\nlook on differences as signs of insubordination and disloyalty. \\nThe Abundance Mentality, on the other hand, flow s out of a deep inner sense of personal worth and \\nsecurity. It is the paradigm that there is plenty out there and enough to spare for everybody. It \\nresults in sharing of prestige, of recognition, of profits, of decision making. It opens possibilities, \\noptions, alternatives, and creativity. \\nThe Abundance Mentality takes the personal joy,  satisfaction, and fulfillment of Habits 1, 2, and 3 \\nand turns it outward, appreciating the uniqueness, the inner direction, the proactive nature of others. \\nIt recognizes the unlimited possibilities for positive  interactive growth and development, creating new \\nThird Alternatives. \\n   Public Victory does not mean victory over other people. It means success in effective interaction \\nthat brings mutually beneficial results to everyone  involved. Public Victory means working together, '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 110}, page_content=\"T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\ncommunicating together, making things happen together that even the same people couldn't make \\nhappen by working independently. And Public Vict ory is an outgrowth of the Abundance Mentality \\nparadigm. \\nA character rich in integrity, maturity, and the Abundance Mentality has a genuineness that goes far \\nbeyond technique, or lack of it, in human interaction. \\nOne thing I have found particularly helpful to wi n-lose people in developing a win-win character is \\nto associate with some model or mentor who really thinks win-win. When people are deeply scripted \\nin win-lose or other philosophies and regularly asso ciate with others who are likewise scripted, they \\ndon't have much opportunity to see and experien ce the win-win philosop h y  i n  a c t i o n .   S o  I \\nrecommend reading literature, such as the inspiring biography of Anwar Sadat, In Search of Identity, \\nand seeing movies like Chariots of Fire or plays like Les Miserables that expose you to models of \\nwin-win. \\nBut remember: If we search deeply enough within ourselves -- beyond the scripting, beyond the \\nlearned attitudes and behaviors -- the real validation of  win-win, as well as every other correct principle, \\nis in our own lives. \\nRelationships \\nFrom the foundation of character, we build and maintain win-win relationships. The trust, the \\nEmotional Bank Account, is the esse nce of win-win.  Without trust, the best we can do is compromise; \\nwithout trust, we lack the credibility for open, mutu al learning and communication and real creativity. \\nBut if our Emotional Bank Account is high, credibility is no longer an issue. Enough deposits have \\nbeen made so that you know and I know that we deeply respect each other. We're focused on the \\nissues, not on personalities or positions. \\nBecause we trust each other, we're open. We put our cards on the table. Even though we see \\nthings differently, I know that you're willing to liste n with respect while I describe the young woman to \\nyou, and you know that I'll treat your description of the old woman with the same respect. We're both \\ncommitted to try to understand each other's point of  view deeply and to work together for the Third \\nAlternative, the synergistic solution, that will be a better answer for both of us. \\nA relationship where bank accounts are high and both parties are deeply committed to win-win is \\nthe ideal springboard for tremendous synergy (Habit 6).  That relationship neither makes  the issues \\nany less real or important, nor elim inates the differences in perspect ive. But it does eliminate the \\nnegative energy normally focused on differences in  personality and position and creates a positive, \\ncooperative energy focused on thoroughly understand ing the issue and resolving them in a mutually \\nbeneficial way. \\nBut what if that kind of relationship isn't ther e? What if you have to work out an agreement with \\nsomeone who hasn't even heard of win-win and is deeply scripted in win-lose or some other \\nphilosophy? \\nDealing with win-lose is the real test of wi n-win.  Rarely is win-win easily achieved in any \\ncircumstance. Deep issues and fundamental differences  have to be dealt with. But it is much easier \\nwhen both parties are aware of and committed to it and where there is a high Emotional Bank Account \\nin the relationship. \\nWhen you're dealing with a person who is coming  from a paradigm of win-lose, the relationship is \\nstill the key. The place to focus is on your Circle of Influence. You make deposits into the Emotional \\nBank Account through genuine courtesy, respect, an d appreciation for that person and for the other \\npoint of view. You stay longer in the communicat ion process. You listen more, you listen in greater \\ndepth. You express yourself with greater courage.  You aren't reactive. You go deeper inside \\nyourself for strength of character to be proactive. You keep hammering it out until the other person \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 111}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nbegins to realize that you genuinely want the resoluti on to be a real win for both of you. That very \\nprocess is a tremendous deposit in the Emotional Bank Account. \\nAnd the stronger you are -- the more genuine yo ur character, the higher your level of proactivity, \\nthe more committed you really are to win-win -- the more powerful your influence will be with that \\nother person. This is the real test of interpersonal leadership.  It goes beyond  transactional leadership \\ninto transformational leadership, transforming the individuals involved as well as the relationship. \\nBecause win-win is a principle people can validat e in their own lives, you will be able to bring most \\npeople to a realization that they will win more of what they want by going for what you both want. \\nBut there will be a few who are so deeply embedded in the win-lose mentalit y that they just won\\'t \\nThink Win-Win.  So remember that no deal is always an option. Or you may occasionally choose to \\ngo for the low form of win-win -- compromise. \\nIt\\'s important to realize that not all decisions need to be win-win, even  when the Emotional Bank \\nAccount is high. Again, the key is the relationship . If you and I worked together, for example, and \\nyou were to come to me and say, \"Stephen, I know yo u won\\'t like this decision. I don\\'t have time to \\nexplain it to you, let alone get you involved. There\\'s a good possibility you\\'ll think it\\'s wrong. But \\nwill you support it?\" \\nIf you had a positive Emotional Bank Account wi th me, of course I\\'d support it. I\\'d hope you were \\nright and I was wrong. I\\'d work to make your decision work. \\nBut if the Emotional Bank Account weren\\'t there, and if I were reactive, I wouldn\\'t really support it. \\nI might say I would to your face, but behind your ba ck I wouldn\\'t be very enthusiastic. I wouldn\\'t \\nmake the investment necessary to make it succeed. \"It didn\\'t work,\" I\\'d say. \"So what do you want \\nme to do now?\" \\nIf I were overreactive, I might even torpedo your decision and do wh at I could to make sure others \\ndid too. Or I might become \"maliciously obedient \" and do exactly and only what you tell me to do, \\naccepting no responsibility for results. \\nDuring the five years I lived in Great Britain, I saw that country brought twice to its knees because \\nthe train conductors were maliciously obedient in following all the rules and procedures written on \\npaper. \\nAn agreement means very little in letter without the character and relationship base to sustain it in \\nspirit. So we need to approach win-win from a genuine desire to invest in the relationships that make \\nit possible. \\nAgreements \\nFrom relationships flow the agreements that gi ve definition and direction to win-win. They are \\nsometimes called performance agreements or partnership agreements, or shifting the paradigm of productive interaction from vertical to horizontal, from hovering supervision to self-supervision, from \\npositioning to being partners in success. \\nWin-Win Agreements cover a wide scope of interdependent interaction.  We discussed one \\nimportant application when we talked about delegation in the \"Green and Clean\" story in Habit 3. The \\nsame five elements we listed there provide the st ructure for Win-Win Agreements between employers \\nand employees, between independent people working to gether on projects, between groups of people \\ncooperatively focused on a common objective, between companies and suppliers  -- between any people \\nwho need to interact to accomplish. They create an  effective way to clarify and manage expectations \\nbetween people involved in any .interdependent endeavor. \\nDesired results (not methods) iden tify what is to be done and when. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 112}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t\\n Guidelines specify the parameters (principles,  policies, etc.) within which results are to be \\naccomplished \\nResources identify the human, financial, technical, or organizational support available to help \\naccomplish the results. \\nAccountability sets up the standards of performance and the time of evaluation. \\nConsequences specify -- good and bad, natural an d logical -- what does and will happen as a result \\nof the evaluation. \\nThese five elements give Win-Win Agreements a life of their own. A clear mutual understanding \\nand agreement up front in these areas creates a st andard against which people can measure their own \\nsuccess. \\nTraditional authoritarian supervision is a win-lose  paradigm. It\\'s also the result of an overdrawn \\nEmotional Bank Account. If you don\\'t have trust or common vision of desire d results, you tend to \\nhover over, check up on, and direct. Trust isn\\'t there,  so you feel as though you have to control people. \\nBut if the trust account is high, what is your me thod?  Get out of  their way.  As long as you have \\nan up-front Win-Win Agreement and they know exactly what  is expected, your role is to be a source of \\nhelp and to receive their accountability reports. \\nIt is much more ennobling to the human spirit to let people judge themselves than to judge them. \\nAnd in a high-trust culture, it\\'s much more accurate. In many case s people know in their hearts how \\nthings are going much better than the records show. Discernment is often far more accurate than \\neither observation or measurement. \\nWin-Win Management Training \\n   Several years ago, I was indirectly involved in a consulting project with a very large banking \\ninstitution that had scores of branches. They wa nted us to evaluate and improve their management \\ntraining program, which was supported by an annual budget of $750,000. The program involved \\nselecting college graduates and putting them th rough twelve two-week assignments in various \\ndepartments over a six-month period of time so that  they could get a general sense of the industry. \\nThey spent two week in commercial loans, two weeks in  industrial loans, two weeks in marketing, two \\nweek in operations, and so forth. At the end of th e six-month period, they were assigned as assistant \\nmanagers in the various branch banks. \\nOur assignment was to evaluate the six-month formal training period. As we began, we discovered \\nthat the most difficult part  of the assignment was to get a clear pi cture of the desired results. We asked \\nthe top executives the key hard question: \"What should these people be able to do when they finish the program?\" And the answers we got were vague and often contradictory. \\nThe training program dealt with methods, not re sults; so we suggested that they set up a pilot \\ntraining program based on a different paradigm called \"learner-controlled instruction.\" This was a \\nWin-Win Agreement that involved identifying specific  objectives and criteria that would demonstrate \\ntheir accomplishment and identifying the guidelines, resources, accoun tability, and consequences that \\nwould result when the objectives wer e met. The consequences in this case were promotion to assistant \\nmanager, where they would receive the on-the-job part  of their training, and a significant increase in \\nsalary. \\nWe had to really press to get the objectives hammered out. \"What is it you want them to \\nunderstand about accounting? Wh at about marketing?  What abou t real estate loans?\"  And we \\nwent down the list. They finally came up with over 100 objectives, which we simplified, reduced, and \\nconsolidated until we came down to 39 specific behavioral objectives with criteria attached to them. \\nThe trainees were highly moti vated by both the opportunity and the increase d salary to meet the \\ncriteria as soon as possible. There was a big win in it for them, and there was also a big win for the '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 113}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\ncompany because they would have assistant branch ma nagers who met results-oriented criteria instead \\nof just showing up for 12 different activity traps. \\nSo we explained the difference between lear ner-controlled instruction and system-controlled \\ninstruction to the trainees. We ba sically said, \"Here are the objectives  and the criteria. Here are the \\nresources, including learning from each other. So go to it. As soon as you meet the criteria, you will \\nbe promoted to assistant managers. \\nThey were finished in thr ee and a half weeks.  Shifting th e training paradigm had released \\nunbelievable motivation and creativity \\nAs with many Paradigm Shifts, there was resist ance. Almost all of the top executives simply \\nwouldn\\'t believe it. When they were shown the eviden ce that the criteria had been met, they basically \\nsaid, \"These trainees don\\'t have the experience. Th ey lack the seasoning necessary to give them the \\nkind of judgment we want them to have as assistant branch managers.\" \\nIn talking with them later, we found that what  many of them were really saying was, \"We went \\nthrough goat week; how come these guys don\\'t have to?\" But of course they couldn\\'t put it that way. \\n\"They lack seasoning\" was a much more acceptable expression. \\n   In addition, for obvious reasons (including  the $750,000 budget for a six-month program), the \\npersonnel department was upset.\\n   So we responded, \"Fair enough.  Let\\'s develop so me more objectives and attach criteria to them. \\nBut let\\'s stay with the paradigm of learner-contr olled instruction.\" We hammered out eight more \\nobjectives with very tough criteria in order to gi ve the executives the assu rance that the people were \\nadequately prepared to be assistant branch managers and continue the on-the-job part of the training \\nprogram. After participating in some of the session s where these criteria were developed, several of \\nthe executives remarked that if the trainees coul d meet these tough criter ia, they would be better \\nprepared than almost any who had gone through the six-month program. \\nWe had prepared the trainees to expect resistance . We took the additional objectives and criteria \\nback to them and said, \"Just as we expected, management wants you to accomplish some additional \\nobjectives with even tougher criteria than before. Th ey have assured us this time that if you meet these \\ncriteria, they will make you assistant managers.\" \\nThey went to work in unbelievable ways. They went to the executives in departments such as \\naccounting and basically said, \"Sir, I am a member of this new pilot program called learner-controlled \\ninstruction, and it is my understanding that you participated in developing the objectives and the \\ncriteria.\" \\n\"I have six criteria to meet in this particular department. I was able to pass three of them off with \\nskills I gained in college; I was able  to get another one out of a book; I learned the fifth one from Tom, \\nthe fellow you trained last week. I only have one criterion left to meet, and I wonder if you or \\nsomeone else in the department might be able to spend a few hours with me to show me how.\" So \\nthey spent a half a day in a de partment instead of two weeks. \\nThese trainees cooperated with each other, b rainstormed with each other, and they accomplished \\nthe additional objectives in a week and a half. Th e six-month program was reduced to five weeks, and \\nthe results were significantly increased. \\nThis kind of thinking can similarly affect every area of organizational life if  people have the courage \\nto explore their paradigms and to concentrate on wi n-win. I am always amazed at the results that \\nhappen, both to individuals and to organizations , when responsible, proactive, self-directing \\nindividuals are turned loose on a task. \\nWin-Win Performance Agreements '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 114}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nCreating Win-Win Performance Agreements requires  vital Paradigm Shifts. The focus is on results; \\nnot methods. Most of us tend to supervise method s. We use the gofer delegation discussed in Habit \\n3, the methods management I used with Sandra when I asked her to take pictures of our son as he was \\nwaterskiing. But Win-Win Agreements focus on results, releasing tremendous individual human \\npotential and creating greater synergy, building PC in  the process instead of focusing exclusively on P \\nWith win-win accountability, people evaluate th emselves. The traditional evaluation games people \\nplay are awkward and emotionally exhausting.  In win-win, people  evaluate themselves, using the \\ncriteria that they themselves helped to create up front. And if you set it up correctly, people can do that. With a Win-Win Delegation Agreement, even a seven-year-old boy can tell for himself how well he\\'s keeping the yard \"green and clean.\" \\nMy best experiences in teaching university cla sses have come when I have created a win-win shared \\nunderstanding of the goal up front. \"This is what  we\\'re trying to accomplish. Here are the basic \\nrequirements for an A, B, or C grad e. My goal is to help every on e of you get an A. Now you take \\nwhat we\\'ve talked about and analyze it and come up with your own understanding of what you want to accomplish that is unique to you. Then let\\'s ge t together and agree on th e grade you wa nt and what \\nyou plan to do to get it.\" \\nManagement philosopher and consultant Peter Dr ucker recommends the use of a \"manager\\'s letter\" \\nto capture the essence of perfor mance agreements between managers and their employees. Following \\na deep and thorough discussion of expectations, guid elines, and resources to make sure they are in \\nharmony with organizational goals, the employee writes a letter to the manager that summarizes the discussion and indicates when the next performa nce plan or review discussion will take place. \\nDeveloping such a Win-Win Agreement is the ce ntral activity of management. With an agreement \\nin place, employees can manage themselves within  the framework of that agreement. The manager \\nthen can serve like a pace car in a race. He can get things going and then get out of the way. His job \\nfrom then on is to remove the oil spills. \\nWhen a boss becomes the first a ssistant to each of his subordinates , he can greatly increase his span \\nof control. Entire levels of administrations and ov erhead are eliminated. Instead of supervising six or \\neight, such a manager can supervise twenty, thirty, fifty, or more. \\nIn Win-Win Agreements, consequences become th e natural or logical results of performance rather \\nthan a reward or punishment arbitrarily handed out by the person in charge. \\nThere are basically four kinds of consequences (rewards and penalties) that management or parents \\ncan control -- financial, psychic, opportunity, and responsibility. Financial consequences include such \\nthings as income, stock options, allowances, or pe nalties.  Psychic or psychological consequences \\ninclude recognition, approval, respect, credibility, or  the loss of them. Unless people are in a survival \\nmode, psychic compensation is often more motiva ting than financial compensation.  Opportunity \\nincludes training, development, perks, and other benefits. Responsibility has to do with scope and authority, either of which can be enlarged or di minished. Win-Win Agreements specify consequences \\nin one or more of those areas and the people involved  know it up front. So you don\\'t play games. \\nEverything is clear from the beginning. \\nIn addition to these logical, personal consequenc es, it is also important to  clearly identify what the \\nnatural organizational consequences are. For example, what will happen if I\\'m late to work, if I refuse \\nto cooperate with others, if I don\\'t develop good Win-Win Agreements with my subordinates, if I don\\'t hold them accountable for desired results, or if I don\\'t promote their professional growth and career \\ndevelopment. \\nWhen my daughter turned 16, we set up a Win- Win Agreement regarding use of the family car. \\nWe agreed that she would obey the laws of the land  and that she would keep the car clean and properly \\nmaintained. We agreed that she would use the car only for responsi ble purposes and would serve as a \\ncab driver for her mother and me within reason. And we also agreed that sh e would do all her other '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 115}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\njobs cheerfully without being reminded. These were our wins. \\nWe also agreed that I would provide some re sources -- the car, gas, and insurance. And we agreed \\nthat she would meet weekly with me, usually on Sunday afternoon, to evaluate how she was doing \\nbased on our agreement. The consequences were clear. As long as she kept he r part of the agreement, \\nshe could use the car. If she didn\\'t keep it, sh e would lose the privilege until she decided to. \\nThis Win-Win Agreement set up clear expectations  from the beginning on both our parts. It was a \\nwin for her -- she got to use the car -- and it was certainly a win for Sandra and me. Now she could \\nhandle her own transportation needs and even so me of ours.  We didn\\'t have to worry about \\nmaintaining the car or keeping it clean. And we had a built-in acco untability, which meant I didn\\'t \\nhave to hover over her to manage her methods.  Her integrity, her conscience, her power of \\ndiscernment and our high Emotional Bank Account ma naged her infinitely better. We didn\\'t have to \\nget emotionally strung out, trying to supervise he r every move and coming up with punishments or \\nrewards on the spot if she didn\\'t do things the way we thought she should. We had a Win-Win \\nAgreement, and it liberated us all. \\nWin-Win Agreements are tremendously liberating. But as the product of isolated techniques, they \\nwon\\'t hold up. Even if you set them up in the beginning, there is no way to maintain them without \\npersonal integrity and relationship of trust. \\nA true Win-Win Agreement is the product of the paradigm, the character, and the relationships out \\nof which it grows. In this context, it defines and directs the interdependent in teraction of which it was \\ncreated. \\n   Win-win can only survive in an  organization when the systems support it. If you talk win-win but \\nreward win-lose, you\\'ve got a losing program on your hands. \\nYou basically get what you reward. If you want to achieve the goals and reflect the values in your \\nmission statement, then you need to  align the reward system with thes e goals and values. If it isn\\'t \\naligned systematically, you won\\'t be walking your ta lk. You\\'ll be in the situation of the manager I \\nmentioned earlier who talked cooperation but practi ced competition by creating a \"Race to Bermuda\" \\ncontest. \\nI worked for several years with a very large real estate organization in the Middle West. My first \\nexperience with this organization was at a large sale s rally where over 800 sales associates gathered for \\nthe annual reward program. It was a psych-up cheer leading session, complete with high school bands \\nand a great deal of frenzied screaming. \\nOut of the 800 people there, around 40 received awards for top performance, such as \"Most Sales,\" \\n\"Greatest Volume,\" \"Highest Earned Commissions,\" an d \"Most Listings.\" There was a lot of hoopla -\\xad\\nexcitement, cheering, applause -- around the presentation of these aw ards. There was no doubt that \\nthose 40 people had won; but there was also the underlying awareness that 760 people had lost. \\nWe immediately began educational and organizat ional development work to align the systems and \\nstructures of the organization toward the win-win paradigm. We involved people at a grass-roots \\nlevel to develop the kinds of systems that would motivate them.  We also encouraged them to \\ncooperate and synergize with each other so that as many as possible could achieve the desired results of \\ntheir individually tailored performance agreements. \\nAt the next rally one year later, there were over  1,000 sales associates present, and about 800 of them \\nreceived awards. There were a few individual winners based on comparisons, but the program \\nprimarily focused on people achieving self-selecte d performance objectives and on groups achieving \\nteam objectives. There was no need to bring in the high school bands to artificially contrive the fanfare, \\nthe cheerleading, and the psych up. There was trem endous natural interest and excitement because \\npeople could share in each others\\' happiness, and te ams of sales associates could experience rewards \\ntogether, including a vacation trip for the entire office. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 116}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nThe remarkable thing was that almost all of the 800 who received the awards that year had \\nproduced as much per person in terms of volume an d profit as the previous year\\'s 40. The spirit of \\nwin-win had significantly increased the number of go lden eggs and had fed the goose as well, releasing \\nenormous human energy and talent. The resultin g synergy was astounding to almost everyone \\ninvolved. \\n   Competition has its place in the marketplace or against last ye ar\\'s performance -- perhaps even \\nagainst another office or individual where there is no  particular interdependence, no need to cooperate. \\nBut cooperation in the workplace is as important to free enterprise as competition in the marketplace. \\nThe spirit of win-win cannot survive in an environment of competition and contests. \\nFor win-win to work, the systems have to support  it. The training system, the planning system, the \\ncommunication system, the budgeting system, the information system, the comp ensation system -- all \\nhave to be based on the principle of win-win. \\nI did some consulting for another company that wa nted training for their people in human relations. \\nThe underlying assumption was th at the problem was the people. \\nThe president said, \"Go into any store you want and see how they treat you. They\\'re just order \\ntakers. They don\\'t understand how to get close to the customers. They don\\'t know the product and \\nthey don\\'t have the knowledge and the skill in the sales process nece ssary to create a marriage between \\nthe product and the need.\" \\nSo I went to the various stores. And he was righ t. But that still didn\\'t answer the question in my \\nmind: What caused the attitude? \\n\"Look, we\\'re on top of the problem,\" the pres ident said. \"We have department heads out there \\nsetting a great example. We\\'ve told them their job is two-thirds selling and one-third management, and they\\'re outselling everybody. We just want yo u to provide some training for the salespeople. \\nThose words raised a red flag. \"Let\\'s get some more data,\" I said. \\nHe didn\\'t like that. He \"knew\" what the problem was, and he wanted to get on with training. But \\nI persisted, and within two days we uncovered the real  problem. Because of the job definition and the \\ncompensation system, the managers were \"creaming. \"  They\\'d stand behind the cash register and \\ncream all the business durin g the slow times. Half the time in retail is slow and the other half is frantic. \\nSo the managers would give all the dirty jobs -- in ventory control, stock work, and cleaning -- to the \\nsalespeople. And they would stand behind the re gisters and cream. That\\'s why the department \\nheads were top in sales. \\nSo we changed one system -- the compensation system -- and the problem was corrected overnight. \\nWe set up a system whereby the managers only made money when their salespeople made money. \\nWe overlapped the needs and goals of the managers wi th the needs and goals of the salespeople. And \\nthe need for human-relations training suddenly disappeared. The key was developing a true win-win \\nreward system. \\nIn another instance, I worked with a manager in a company that required formal performance \\nevaluation. He was frustrated over the evaluation  rating he had given a particular manager. \"He \\ndeserved a three,\" he said, \"but I had to give him a one\" (which meant superior, promotable). \\n\"What did you give him a one for?\" I asked. \\n\"He gets the numbers,\" was his reply. \\n\"So why do you think he deserves a three?\" \\n\"It\\'s the way he gets them. He neglects pe ople; he runs over them. He\\'s a troublemaker.\" \\n\"It sounds like he\\'s totally focused on P -- on pr oduction. And that\\'s what he\\'s being rewarded for. \\nBut what would happen if you talk ed with him about the problem, if you helped him understand the \\nimportance of PC?\" \\nHe said he had done so, with no effect. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 117}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\n\"Then what if you set up a win-win contract with  him where you both agreed  that two-thirds of his \\ncompensation would come from P -- from numbers -- and the other one-thir d would come from PC -- \\nhow other people perceive him, what kind of leader, people builder, team builder he is?\" \\n\"Now that would get his attention,\" he replied. \\nSo often the problem is in the system, not in th e people. If you put good people in bad systems, \\nyou get bad results. You have to water the flowers you want to grow. \\nAs people really learn to Think Win-Win, they can set up the systems to create and reinforce it. \\nThey can transform unnecessarily competitive situatio ns to cooperative ones and can powerfully impact \\ntheir effectiveness by building both P and PC. \\nIn business, executives can align their systems to  create teams of highly productive people working \\ntogether to compete against external standards of performance. In education, teachers can set up \\ngrading systems based on an individual\\'s performanc e in the context of agreed-upon criteria and can \\nencourage students to cooperate in productive ways to  help each other learn and achieve. In families, \\nparents can shift the focus from competition with each  other to cooperation. In activities such as \\nbowling, for example, they can keep a family score and try to beat a previous one. They can set up \\nhome responsibilities with Win-Win Agreements that eliminate constant nagging and enable parents to \\ndo the things only they can do. \\nA friend once shared with me  a cartoon he\\'d seen of two childre n talking to each other. \"If mommy \\ndoesn\\'t get us up soon,\" one was saying, \"we\\'re going to be late for school.\" These words brought \\nforcibly to his attention the nature of the proble ms created when families are not organized on a \\nresponsible win-win basis. \\nWin-win puts the responsibility on the individu al for accomplishing specified results within clear \\nguidelines and available resources. It makes a pers on accountable to perform and evaluate the results \\nand provides consequences as a natural result of  performance.  And win-win systems create the \\nenvironment which supports and reinforces the Win-Win Agreements. \\nProcesses \\nThere\\'s no way to achieve win-win ends with wi n-lose or lose-win means. You can\\'t say, \"You\\'re \\ngoing to Think Win-Win, whether you like it or not.\" So the question becomes how to arrive at a \\nwin-win solution. \\nRoger Fisher and William Ury, two Harvard law professors, have done some outstanding work in \\nwhat they call the \"principled\" approach versus th e \"positional\" approach to bargaining in their \\ntremendously useful and insightful  book, Getting to Yes. Although the words win-win are not used, \\nthe spirit and underlying philosophy of the b ook are in harmony with  the win-win approach. \\nThey suggest that the essence of principled negotiation is to se parate the person from the problem, \\nto focus on interests and not on positions, to invent  options for mutual gain, and to insist on objective \\ncriteria -- some external standard or pr inciple that both parties can buy into. \\nIn my own work with various people and orga nizations seeking win-win solutions, I suggest that \\nthey become involved in the following four-step proc ess: First, see the problem from the other point of \\nview. Really seek to understand and give expressi on to the needs and concerns of the other party as \\nwell as or better than they can themselves. Second, id entify the key issues and concerns (not positions) \\ninvolved. Third, determine what results would consti tute a fully  acceptable solution.  And fourth, \\nidentify possible new options to achieve those results. \\nHabits 5 and 6 deal directly with two of the el ements of this process, an d we will go into those in \\ndepth in the next two chapters. \\nBut at this juncture, let me point out the highly interrelated natu re of the process of win-win with \\nthe essence of win-win itself. You can only achiev e win-win solutions with win-win processes -- the '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 118}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nend and the means are the same. \\nWin-win is not a personality technique. It\\'s a total paradigm of human interaction. It comes from \\na character of integrity, maturity, and the Abunda nce Mentality.  It grows out of high-trust \\nrelationships. It is embodied in agreements that effectively clarify and manage expectations as well as \\naccomplishments. It thrives in supportive systems. And it is achieved through the process we are \\nnow prepared to more fully examine in Habits 5 and 6. \\nApplication Suggestions: \\n1. Think about an upcoming interaction wherei n you will be attempting to reach an agreement or \\nnegotiate a solution. Commit to maintain a balance between courage and consideration. \\n2. Make a list of obstacles that keep you from applying the win-win paradigm more frequently. \\nDetermine what could be done within your Circle of  Influence to eliminate some of those obstacles. \\n3. Select a specific relationship where you would like to develop a Win- Win Agreement.  Try to \\nput yourself in the other person\\'s place, and write down explicitly how you think that person sees the \\nsolution. Then list, from your own perspective, what results would constitute a win for you. \\nApproach the other person and ask if he or she would be willing to communicate until you reach a \\npoint of agreement and mutually beneficial solution. \\n4. Identify three key relationships in your life.  Give some indication of what you feel the balance \\nis in each of the Emotional Bank Accounts. Write down some specific ways you could make deposits \\nin each account. \\n5. Deeply consider your own scripting.  Is it win-lose? How does that scripting affect your \\ninteractions with other people? Can you identify th e main source of that script? Determine whether \\nor not those scripts serve well in your current reality. \\n6. Try to identify a model of win-win thinking who, even in hard situat ions, really seeks mutual \\nbenefit. Determine now to more closely wa tch and learn from this person\\'s example. \\nHabit 5: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood TM \\nPrinciples of Empathic Communication \\nThe heart has its reasons which reason knows not of. \\n   - -P a s c a l \\nSuppose you\\'ve been having troubl e with your eyes and you decide to go to an optometrist for help. \\nAfter briefly listening to your complaint, he takes off his glasses and hands them to you. \\n\"Put these on,\" he says. \"I\\'ve worn this pair of glasses for 10 years now and they\\'ve really helped \\nme. I have an extra pair at home; you can wear these.\" \\nSo you put them on, but it only makes the problem worse \\n\"This is terrible!\" you exclaim. \"I can\\'t see a thing!\" \\n\"Well, what\\'s wrong?\" he asks. \"They work great for me. Try harder.\" \\n\"I am trying,\" you insist. \"Everything is a blur.\" \\n\"Well, what\\'s the matter with you? Think positively.\" \\n\"Okay. I positively can\\'t see a thing.\" \\n\"Boy, you are ungrateful!\" he chides. \"And after all I\\'ve done to help you!\" \\nWhat are the chances you\\'d go back to that op tometrist the next time you need help? Not very \\ngood, I would imagine. You don\\'t have much confid ence in someone who doesn\\'t diagnose before he '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 119}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nor she prescribes. \\nBut how often do we diagnose before we prescribe in communication? \\n\"Come on, honey, tell me how you feel. I know it\\'s hard, but I\\'ll try to understand.\" \\n\"Oh, I don\\'t know, Mom. You\\'d think it was stupid.\" \\n   \"Of course I wouldn\\'t!  You can tell me.  Honey,  no one cares for you as much as I do. I\\'m only \\ninterested in your welfare. What\\'s making you so unhappy?\" \\n   \"Oh, I don\\'t know.\" \\n   \"Come on, honey.  What is it?\" \\n\"Well, to tell you the truth, I just don\\'t like school anymore.\" \\n\"What?\" you respond incredulously. \"What do you mean you don\\'t like school? And after all the \\nsacrifices we\\'ve made for your education! Education is the foundation of your  future. If you\\'d apply \\nyourself like your older sister does, you\\'d do better and then you\\'d like school. Time and time again, \\nwe\\'ve told you to settle down. You\\'ve got the ability, but you just don\\'t apply yourself. Try harder. Get a positive attitude about it.\" \\nPause \\n\"Now go ahead. Tell me how you feel.\" \\nWe have such a tendency to rush in, to fix thin gs up with good advice. But we often fail to take the \\ntime to diagnose, to really, deep ly understand the problem first. \\nIf I were to summarize in one sentence the single  most important principle I have learned in the field \\nof interpersonal relations, it would be this: Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood. This \\nprinciple is the key to effective interpersonal communication. \\nCharacter and Communication \\nRight now, you\\'re reading a book I\\'ve wri tten.  Reading and writing are both forms of \\ncommunication. So are speaking and listening.  In fact, those are the four basic types of \\ncommunication. And think of all the hours you spen d doing at least one of those four things. The \\nability to do them well is absolutely  critical to your effectiveness. \\nCommunication is the most important skill in life.  We spend most  of our waking hours \\ncommunicating. But consider this: You\\'ve spent years learning how to read and write, years learning \\nhow to speak. But what about listening? What t raining or education have you had that enables you \\nto listen so that you really, deeply understand an other human being from that individual\\'s own frame \\nof reference? \\nComparatively few people have had any training in  listening at all. And, for the most part, their \\ntraining has been in the personality ethic of technique, truncated from the character base and the relationship base absolutely vital to au thentic understanding of another person. \\nIf you want to interact effectively with me, to in fluence me -- your spouse, yo ur child, your neighbor, \\nyour boss, your coworker, your friend -- you first n eed to understand me. And you can\\'t do that with \\ntechnique alone. If I sense you\\'re using some tec hnique, I sense duplicity, manipulation. I wonder \\nwhy you\\'re doing it, what your motives are. And I don\\' t feel safe enough to open myself up to you. \\nThe real key to your influence with me is your example, your actual conduct. Your example flows \\nnaturally out of your character, of the kind of person you truly are --  not what others say you are or \\nwhat you may want me to think you are. It is  evident in how I actually experience you. \\nYour character is constantly radiating, communi cating.  From it, in the long run, I come to \\ninstinctively trust or distrust you and your efforts with me. \\n   If your life runs hot and cold, if you\\'re both caustic and kind, and, above all, if your private \\nperformance doesn\\'t square with your public performance, it\\'s very hard for me to open up with you. \\nThen, as much as I may want and even  need to receive your love and in fluence, I don\\'t feel safe enough '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 120}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nto expose my opinions and experiences and my tender feelings. Who knows what will happen? \\nBut unless I open up with you, unless you understand me and my unique situation and feelings, you \\nwon\\'t know how to advise or counsel me. What you say is good and fine, but it doesn\\'t quite pertain \\nto me. \\nYou may say you care about and appreciate me. I desperately want to believe that. But how can \\nyou appreciate me when you don\\'t even understand me? All I have are your words, and I can\\'t trust \\nwords. \\nI\\'m too angry and defensive -- perhaps too guilty an d afraid -- to be influenced, even though inside I \\nknow I need what you could tell me. \\nUnless you\\'re influenced by my uniqueness, I\\'m no t going to be influenced by your advice. So if \\nyou want to be really effective in the habit of interpersonal communication, you cannot do it with technique alone. You have to build the skills of empa thic listening on a base of character that inspires \\nopenness and trust. And you have to build the Em otional Bank Accounts that create a commerce \\nbetween hearts. \\nEmpathic Listening \\n\"Seek first to understand\" involves a very deep shift in paradigm. We typically seek first to be \\nunderstood. Most people do not listen with the intent to understand; they listen with the intent to reply. They\\'re either speaking or preparing to sp eak.  They\\'re filtering ev erything through their own \\nparadigms, reading their autobiography into other people\\'s lives. \\n\"Oh, I know exactly how you feel!\" \\n\"I went through the very same thing. Let me tell you about my experience.\" \\nThey\\'re constantly projecting their own home mo vies onto other people\\'s behavior. They prescribe \\ntheir own glasses for everyone with whom they interact. \\nIf they have a problem with someone -- a son, a daughter, a spouse, an employee -- their attitude is, \\n\"That person just doesn\\'t understand.\" \\nA father once told me, \"I can\\'t understand my kid. He just won\\'t listen to me at all.\" \\n\"Let me restate what you just said,\" I replied. \"You don\\'t understand your son because he won\\'t \\nlisten to you?\" \\n   \"That\\'s right,\" he replied. \\n\"Let me try again,\" I said. \"You don\\'t unde rstand your son because he won\\'t listen to you?\" \\n\"That\\'s what I said,\" he impatiently replied. \\n\"I thought that to understand another pers on, you needed to listen to him,\" I suggested. \\n\"OH!\" he said. There was a long pause. \"Oh!\" he said again, as the light began to dawn. \"Oh, \\nyeah! But I do understand him. I know what he \\'s going through. I went through the same thing \\nmyself. I guess what I don\\'t understa nd is why he won\\'t listen to me.\" \\nThis man didn\\'t have the vaguest idea of what  was really going on inside his boy\\'s head. He \\nlooked into his own head and thought he saw the world, including his boy. \\nThat\\'s the case with so many  of us. We\\'re filled with our own rightness, our own autobiography. \\nWe want to be understood. Our conversations become collective monologues, and we never really understand what\\'s going on inside another human being. \\nWhen another person speaks, we\\'re usually \"liste ning\" at one of four leve ls.  We may be ignoring \\nanother person, not really listening at all. We ma y practice pretending. \"Yeah.  Uh-huh. Right.\" \\nWe may practice selective listening, hearing only certain parts of the constant chatter of a preschool \\nchild. Or we may even practice attentive listening, paying attention and focusing energy on the words \\nthat are being said. But very few of us ever prac tice the fifth level, the highest form of listening, \\nempathic listening. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 121}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nWhen I say empathic listening, I am not referring to  the techniques of \"active\" listening or \"reflective\" \\nlistening, which basically involve mimicking what another person says.  That kind of listening is \\nskill-based, truncated from character and relationship, and often insults those \"listened\" to in such a \\nway. It is also essentially autobiographical. If  you practice those techni ques, you may not project \\nyour autobiography in the actual interaction, but yo ur motive in listening is  autobiographical. You \\nlisten with reflective skills, but you listen with intent to reply, to control, to manipulate. \\n   When I say empathic listening, I mean listening with in tent to understand. I mean seeking first to \\nunderstand, to really understand. It\\'s an entirely different paradigm. \\nEmpathic (from empathy) listening gets inside another person\\'s frame of reference. You look out \\nthrough it, you see the world the way they see the world, you understand their paradigm, you \\nunderstand how they feel. \\nEmpathy is not sympathy. Sympathy is a form  of agreement, a form of judgment. And it is \\nsometimes the more appropriate emotion and response.  But people often feed on sympathy.  It makes them dependent. The essence of empathic listeni ng is not that you agree with someone; it\\'s that \\nyou fully, deeply, understand that person , emotionally as well as intellectually. \\n   Empathic listening in volves much more than registering, reflecting, or even understanding the \\nwords that are said. Communications experts es timate, in fact, that only 10 percent of our \\ncommunication is represented by the words we say. Another 30 percent is represented by our sounds, \\nand 60 percent by our body language. In empathic listening, you listen with your ears, but you also, \\nand more importantly, listen with your eyes and with your heart. You listen for feeling, for meaning. \\nYou listen for behavior. You use your right brain as well as your left. You sense, you intuit, you feel. \\nEmpathic listening is so powerful because it gives you accurate data to work with. Instead of \\nprojecting your own autobiography and assuming thou ght, feelings, motives, and interpretation, you\\'re \\ndealing with the reality inside another person\\'s head and heart.  You\\'re listening to understand. \\nYou\\'re focused on receiving the deep communication of another human soul. \\nIn addition, empathic listening is the key to making deposits in Emotional Bank Accounts, because \\nnothing you do is a deposit unless the other person pe rceives it as such. You can work your fingers to \\nthe bone to make a deposit, only to have it turn in to a withdrawal when a pers on regards your efforts as \\nmanipulative, self-serving, intimidating, or conde scending because you don\\'t understand what really \\nmatters to him. \\nEmpathic listening is, in and of itself, a tremendous deposit in the Emotional Bank Account. It\\'s \\ndeeply therapeutic and healing because it gives a person \"psychological air. \\nIf all the air were suddenly sucked out of the room you\\'re in right now, what would happen to your \\ninterest in this book? You wouldn\\'t care about the book; you wouldn\\'t care about anything except \\ngetting air. Survival would be your only motivation. \\nBut now that you have air, it doesn\\'t motivate you. This is one of the greatest insights in the field of \\nhuman motivations: Satisfied needs do not motivate. It\\'s only the unsatisfied need that motivates. \\nNext to physical survival, the greatest need of a human being is psychological survival -- to be \\nunderstood, to be affirmed, to be validated, to be appreciated. \\nWhen you listen with empathy to another person, you give that person psychological air. And \\nafter that vital need is met, you can then  focus on influencing or problem solving. \\nThis need for psychological air impa cts communication in every area of life. \\nI taught this concept at a seminar in Chicago on e time, and I instructed the participants to practice \\nempathic listening during the evening. The next mo rning, a man came up to me almost bursting with \\nnews. \\n\"Let me tell you what happened last night,\" he said. \"I was trying to close a big commercial real \\nestate deal while I was here in Chicago. I met wi th the principals, their attorneys, and another real \\nestate agent who had just been brought in with an alternative proposal. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 122}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\n\"It looked as if I were going to lose the deal. I had been working on this deal for over six months \\nand, in a very real sense, all my eggs were in th is one basket.  All of them.  I panicked.  I did \\neverything I could -- I pulled out all the stops -- I used every sales technique I could. The final stop \\nwas to say, \\'Could we delay this decision just a little longer?\\' But the momentum was so strong and \\nthey were so disgusted by having this thing go on so long, it was obvious they were going to close. \\n\"So I said to myself, \\'Well, why not try it? Wh y not practice what I learned today and seek first to \\nunderstand, then to be understood? I\\'ve got nothing to lose.\\' \\n\" I  j u s t  s a i d  t o  t h e  m a n ,  \\' L e t  m e  s e e  i f  I  r e a l l y  u n d e r s t a n d  w h a t  y o u r  p o s i t i o n  i s  a n d  w h a t  y o u r \\nconcerns about my recommendations really are. Wh en you feel I understand them, then we\\'ll see \\nwhether my proposal has any relevance or not.\\' \\n\"I really tried to put myself in his shoes. I tried to verbalize his needs and concerns, and he began \\nto open up. \\n\"The more I sensed and expressed the things he  was worried about, the results he anticipated, the \\nmore he opened up. \\n\"Finally, in the middle of our conversation, he stood up, walked over to the phone, and dialed his \\nwife. Putting his hand over the mouthp iece, he said, \\'You\\'ve got the deal.\\' \\n\"I was totally dumbfounded,\" he told me. \"I still am this morning. \\nHe had made a huge deposit in the Emotional Bank Account by giving the man psychological air. \\nWhen it comes right down to it, other things be ing relatively equal, the human dynamic is more \\nimportant than the technical dimensions of the deal. \\nSeeking first to understand, diagnosing before yo u prescribe, is hard. It\\'s so much easier in the \\nshort run to hand someone a pair of glasses that have fit you so well these many years. \\nBut in the long run, it severely deplet es both P and PC.  You can\\'t achieve maximum \\ninterdependent production from an inaccurate understanding of where other people are coming from. \\nAnd you can\\'t have interpersonal PC -- high Emotional Bank Accounts -- if the people you relate with \\ndon\\'t really feel understood. \\nEmpathic listening is also risky. It takes a great deal of security to go into a deep listening \\nexperience because you open yourself  up to be influenced. You become vulnerable. It\\'s a paradox, in \\na sense, because in order to have influence, you have  to be influenced. That means you have to really \\nunderstand. \\nThat\\'s why Habits 1, 2, and 3 are so foundation al. They give you the changeless inner core, the \\nprinciple center, from which you can handle the mo re outward vulnerability with peace and strength. \\nDiagnose Before You Prescribe \\nAlthough it\\'s risky and hard, s eek first to understand, or diagnose before you prescribe, is a correct \\nprinciple manifesting many areas of lif e. It\\'s the mark of all true prof essionals. It\\'s critical for the \\noptometrist, it\\'s critical for the physician. You woul dn\\'t have any confidence in a doctor\\'s prescription \\nunless you had confidence in the diagnosis \\nWhen our daughter Jenny was only two months ol d, she was sick on Saturday, the day of a football \\ngame in our community that dominated the consciousness of almost everyone. It was an important game -- some 60,000 people were there. Sandra and I would like to have gone, but we didn\\'t want to \\nleave little Jenny. Her vomiting and diarrhea had us concerned \\nThe doctor was at that game. He wasn\\'t our personal physician, but he was the one on call. When \\nJenny\\'s situation got worse, we decided we needed some medical advice \\nSandra dialed the stadium and had him paged. It  was right at a critical time in the game, and she \\ncould sense on officious tone in his voice. \"Yes?\" he said briskly. \"What is it?\" \\n\"This is Mrs. Covey, Doctor, and we\\'re concerned about our daughter, Jenny.\" '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 123}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\n\"What\\'s the situation?\" he asked. \\nSandra described the symptoms and he said, \"Ok ay. I\\'ll call in a prescription. Which is your \\npharmacy?\" \\nWhen she hung up, Sandra felt that in her rush she hadn\\'t really given him full data, but that what \\nshe had told him was adequate. \\n\"Do you think he realizes that Jenny is just a newborn?\" I asked her \\n\"I\\'m sure he does,\" Sandra replied. \\n\"But he\\'s not our doctor. He\\'s never even treated her.\" \\n\"Well, I\\'m pretty sure he knows.\" \\n\"Are you willing to give her the medicine  unless you\\'re absolutely sure he knows?\" \\n   Sandra was silent.  \"What are we going to do?\" she finally said. \\n\"Call him back,\" I said. \\n\"You call him back,\" Sandra replied. \\nSo I did. He was paged out of the game once again. \"Doctor,\" I said, \"when you called in that \\nprescription, did your realize that Jenny is just two months old?\" \\n\"No!\" he exclaimed. \"I didn\\'t realize that .  It\\'s good you called me back.  I\\'ll change the \\nprescription immediately.\" \\nIf you don\\'t have confidence in the diagnosi s, you won\\'t have confidence in the prescription. \\nThis principle is also true in sales. An effective salesperson first seeks to understand the needs, the \\nconcerns, the situation of the customer. The amateu r salesman sells products; the professional sells \\nsolutions to needs and problems. It\\'s a totally di fferent approach. The professional learns how to \\ndiagnose, how to understand. He also learns how to relate people\\'s needs to his products and services. \\nAnd, he has to have the integrity to say, \"My produc t or service will not meet that need\" if it will not. \\nDiagnosing before you prescribe is also fundamen tal to law. The professional lawyer first gathers \\nthe facts to understand the situation, to understand  the laws and precedents, before preparing a case. \\nA good lawyer almost writes the opposing a ttorney\\'s case before he writes his own. \\nIt\\'s also true in product design. Can you imagine someone in a compan y saying, \"This consumer \\nresearch stuff is for the birds.  Let\\'s design produc ts.\"  In other words, forget understanding the \\nconsumer\\'s buying habits and motives -- just  design products. It would never work. \\nA good engineer will understand the forces, th e stresses at work, before designing the bridge. A \\ngood teacher will assess the class before teaching. A good student will understand before he applies. \\nA good parent will understand before evaluation  or judging.  The key to good judgment is \\nunderstanding.  By judging first, a person will never fully understand. \\nSeek first to understand is a correct principl e evident in all areas of life. It\\'s a generic, \\ncommon-denominator principle, but it has its greatest power in the area of interpersonal relations. \\nFour Autobiographical Responses \\nBecause we listen autobiographically, we tend to respond in one of four ways. We evaluate -- we \\neither agree or disagree; we probe -- we ask question s from our own frame of reference; we advise -- we \\ngive counsel based on our own experience; or we interp ret -- we try to figure people out, to explain their \\nmotives, their behavior, based on our own motives and behavior. \\nThese responses come naturally to us. We are  deeply scripted in them; we live around models of \\nthem all the time. But how do they a ffect our ability to really understand? \\nIf I\\'m trying to communicate with my son, can he  feel free to open himself up to me when I evaluate \\neverything he says before he really explains it? Am I giving him psychological air? \\nAnd how does he feel when I probe? Probing is playing 20 questions. It\\'s autobiographical, it \\ncontrols, and it invades. It\\'s also logical, and the language of logic is different from the language of '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 124}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nsentiment and emotion. You can play 20 question s all day and not find out what\\'s important to \\nsomeone. Constant probing is one of the main re asons parents do not get close to their children. \\n   \"How\\'s it going, son?\" \\n   \" F i n e . \" \\n\"Well, what\\'s been happening lately?\" \\n   \"Nothing.\"    \"So what\\'s exciting at school?\" \\n   \" N o t m u c h . \" \\n\"And what are your plans for the weekend?\" \\n   \"I don\\'t know.\" \\nYou can\\'t get him off the phone talking with his friends, but all he gives you is one- and two-word \\nanswers. Your house is a motel where he eats and sleeps, but he never shares, never opens up. \\nAnd when you think about it, honestly, why shou ld he, if every time he does open up his soft \\nunderbelly, you elephant stomp it with autobiographical advice and \"I told you so\\'s.\" \\nWe are so deeply scripted in these responses th at we don\\'t even realize when we use them. I have \\ntaught this concept to thousands of people in semi nars across the country, and it never fails to shock \\nthem deeply as we role-play empathic listening situat ions and they finally begin to listen to their own \\ntypical responses. But as they begin to see how they normally respond and learn how to listen with \\nempathy, they can see the dramatic results in comm unication. To many, seek first to understand \\nbecomes the most exciting, the most immedi ately applicable, of all the Seven Habits. \\nLet\\'s take a look at what well might be a typ ical communication between a father and his teenage \\nson. Look at the father\\'s words in terms of th e four different responses we have just described. \\n\"Boy, Dad, I\\'ve had it! School is for the birds!\" \\n\"What\\'s the matter, Son?\" (probing). \\n\"It\\'s totally impractical. I don\\'t get a thing out of it.\" \\n\"Well, you just can\\'t see the benefits yet, So n.

You\\'ve got to be kidding\" (evaluating). \\n\"No, I\\'m not. Look at Joe. He\\'s quit school. He\\'s working on cars. And he\\'s making lots of \\nmoney. Now that\\'s practical.\" \\n\"It may look that way now. But several years down the road, Joe\\'s going to wish he\\'d stayed in \\nschool. You don\\'t want to be an auto mechanic. You need an educ ation to prepare you for something \\nbetter than that\" (advising). \\n\"I don\\'t know. Joe\\'s got a pretty good set-up.\" \\n\"Look, Son, have you really tried?\" (probing, evaluating). \\n   \"I\\'ve been in high school  two years now. Sure I\\'ve tried. It\\'s just a waste.\" \\n\"That\\'s a highly respected school, Son. Give them a little credit\" (advising, evaluating). \\n\"Well, the other guys feel the same way I do.\" \\n\"Do you realize how many sacrifices your moth er and I have made to get you to where you are?\\nYou can\\'t quit when you\\'ve come this far\" (evaluating). \\n\"I know you\\'ve sacrificed, Dad. But it\\'s just not worth it.\" \\n\"Look, maybe if you spent more time doing your homework and less time in front of TV.\" (advising, \\nevaluating). \\n   \"Look, Dad.  It\\'s just no good.

School is for the birds!\" (I want to talk with you, to get your attention.) \\n   \"What\\'s the matter, Son?\"  (You\\'re interested! Good!) \\n\"It\\'s totally impractical.

I don\\'t really \\ncare how many miles he had to trudge through the sn ow to school without any boots. I want to get to \\nthe problem.) \"I remember thinking what a waste some of the classes were.

You\\'ve got to be kidding.\"  ( He wouldn\\'t like me if I were an auto mechanic. \\nHe wouldn\\'t like me if I didn\\'t finish school. I have to justify what I said.) \\n\"No, I\\'m not. Look at Joe. He\\'s quit school. He\\'s working on cars. And he\\'s making lots of \\nmoney. Now that\\'s practical.\" \\n\"It may look that way now. But several years down the road, Joe\\'s going to wish he\\'d stayed in \\nschool.\" (Oh, Boy! here comes lecture number 16 on  the value of an education.) \"You don\\'t want to \\nbe an auto mechanic.\" (How do you know that, Dad? Do you really have any idea what I want?) \\n\"You need an education to prepare you for something better than that.\" \\n\"I don\\'t know. Joe\\'s got a pretty good set-up.\" (He\\'s not a failure. He didn\\'t finish school and \\nhe\\'s not a failure.) \\n   \"Look, Son, have you really tried?\"  (We\\'re beating around the bush, Dad. If you\\'d just listen, I really need to talk to you about something important.) \\n   \"I\\'ve been in high school  two years now. Sure I\\'ve tried. It\\'s just a waste.\" \\n\"That\\'s a highly respected school, Son. Give them a little credit.\"  (Oh, great.  Now we\\'re talking \\ncredibility. I wish I could talk about what I want to talk about.) \\n\"Well, the other guys feel the same way I do.\" (I have some credibility, too. I\\'m not a moron.) \\n\"Do you realize how many sacrifices your moth er and I have made to get you where you are?\" \\n(Uh-oh, here comes the guilt trip. Maybe I am a moron. The school\\'s great, Mom and Dad are great, \\nand I\\'m a moron.) \"You can\\'t quit when you\\'ve come this far.\" \\n\"I know you\\'ve sacrificed, Dad. But it\\'s just not worth it.\" (You just don\\'t understand.) \\n\"Look, maybe if you spent more time doing your homework and less time in front of TV...\" (That\\'s \\nnot the problem, Dad! That\\'s not it at all! I\\' ll never be able to tell you. I was dumb to try.) \\n   \"Look, Dad.  It\\'s just no good.  Oh, never mind! I don\\'t want to talk about this anyway.\" \\nCan you see how limited we are when we try to understand another person  on the basis of words \\nalone, especially when we\\'re lo oking at that person through our own glasses? Can you see how \\nlimiting our autobiographical responses are to a person who is genuinely trying to get us to understand \\nhis autobiography? \\nYou will never be able to truly step inside another person, to see the world as he sees it, until you \\ndevelop the pure desire, the stren gth of personal character, and the positive Emotional Bank Account, \\nas well as the empathic listening skills to do it. \\nThe skills, the tip of the iceberg of empath ic listening, involve four developmental stages \\nThe first and least effective is to mimic content. This is the skill taught in \"active\" or \"reflective\" \\nlistening. Without the character and relationship base, it is often insulting to people and causes them '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 126}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nto close up. It is, however, a first-stage skill because it  at least causes you to listen to what\\'s being said \\nMimicking content is easy. You just listen to the words that come out of  someone\\'s mouth and you \\nrepeat them. You\\'re hardly even using your brain at all \\n\"Boy, Dad, I\\'ve had it! School is for the birds!\" \\n\"You\\'ve had it. You think school is for the birds.\" \\nYou have essentially repeated back the content of what was being said. You haven\\'t evaluated or \\nprobed or advised or interpreted. You\\'ve at least showed you\\'re paying attention to his words. But \\nto understand, you want to do more. \\nThe second stage of empathic listening is to rephras e the content. It\\'s a little more effective, but it\\'s \\nstill limited to the verbal communication \\n\"Boy, Dad, I\\'ve had it! School is for the birds!\" \\n\"You don\\'t want to go to school anymore.\" \\nThis time, you\\'ve put his meaning into your ow n words. Now you\\'re thinking about what he said, \\nmostly with the left side, the reasoning, logical side of the brain. \\nThe third stage brings your right brain into operation. You reflect feeling. \\n\"Boy, Dad, I\\'ve had it! School is for the birds!\" \\n   \"You\\'re feeling really frustrated.\" \\nNow you\\'re not paying as much attention to what he\\'s saying as you are to the way he feels about \\nwhat he\\'s saying. The fourth stage includes both the second and the third. You rephrase the content \\nand reflect the feeling. \\n\"Boy, Dad, I\\'ve had it! School is for the birds!\" \\n\"You\\'re really frustrated about school.\" \\nFrustration is the feeling; school is the content. You\\'re using both sides of your brain to understand \\nboth sides of his communication. \\n   Now, what happens when you us e fourth stage empathic listening sk ills is really incredible. As \\nyou authentically seek to understand, as you re phrase content and reflect feeling, you give him \\npsychological air. You also help him work through his own thoughts and feelings. As he grows in \\nhis confidence of your sincere desire to really lis ten and understand, the barrier between what\\'s going \\non inside him and what\\'s actually being communicated to you disappears. It opens a soul-to-soul flow. \\nHe\\'s not thinking and feeling one thing and communica ting another. He begins to trust you with his \\ninnermost tender feelings and thoughts. \\n\"Boy, Dad, I\\'ve had it! School is for the birds!\" (I want to talk with you to get your attention.) \\n\"You\\'re really frustrated about school.\"  (That\\'s right!  That\\'s how I feel.) \\n   \"I sure am.  It\\'s totally impractica l. I\\'m not getting a thing out of it.\" \\n\"You feel like school\\'s not doing you any good .\" (Let me think -- is that what I mean?) \\n\"Well, yeah. I\\'m just not learning anything that \\'s going to help me. I mean, look at Joe. He\\'s \\ndropped out of school and he\\'s working on cars. He\\'s making money. Now that\\'s practical.\" \\n\"You feel that Joe really has the right idea.\" (Well...) \\n\"Well, I guess he does in a way. He\\'s really  making money now. But in a few years I bet he\\'ll \\nprobably be ticked off at himself.\" \\n\"You think Joe\\'s going to f eel he made the wrong decision.\" \\n\"He\\'s got to. Just look at what he\\'s giving up . I mean, if you don\\'t have an education, you just \\ncan\\'t make it in this world.\" \\n   \"Education is really important.\" \\n\"Oh, yeah! I mean, if you don\\'t have a diploma, if you can\\'t get jobs or go to college, what are you \\ngoing to do? You\\'ve just got to get an education.\" \\n   \"It\\'s important to your future.\" \\n\"It is. And, you know what? I\\'m really worried. Listen, you won\\'t tell Mom, will you?\" '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 127}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\n\"You don\\'t want your mother to find out.\" \\n\"Well, not really. Oh, I guess you can tell her. She\\'ll probably find out anyway. Look, I took this \\ntest today, this reading test. And, Dad, they said I\\'m reading on a fourth-grade level. Fourth grade! \\nAnd I\\'m in junior high school!\" \\nWhat a difference real understanding can make! All the well-meaning advice in the world won\\'t \\namount to a hill of beans if we\\'re  not even addressing the real problem. And we\\'ll never get to the \\nproblem if we\\'re so caught up in our own autobi ography, our own paradigms, that we don\\'t take off \\nour glasses long enough to see the world from another point of view. \\n\"I\\'m going to flunk, Dad. I guess I figure if I\\'m going to flunk, I might as well quit. But I don\\'t \\nwant to quit.\" \\n\"You feel torn. You\\'re in the middle of a dilemma.\" \\n\"What do you think I should do, Dad?\" \\nBy seeking first to understand, this father has just turned a transact ional opportunity into a \\ntransformational opportunity. Instead of interacting on a surf ace, get-the-job-done level of \\ncommunication, he has created a situ ation in which he can now have transforming impact, not only on \\nhis son but also on the relationsh ip. By setting aside his own auto biography and really seeking to \\nunderstand, he has made a tremendous deposit in the Emotional Bank Account and has empowered his \\nson to open, layer upon layer, and to get to the real issue. \\nNow father and son are on the same side of the table looking at the problem, instead of on opposite \\nsides looking across at each other. The son is op ening his father\\'s autobiography and asking for \\nadvice. \\nEven as the father begins to counsel, however, he needs to be sensitive to his son\\'s communication. \\nAs long as the response is logical, the father can effectively ask questions and give counsel. But the \\nmoment the response becomes emotional, he needs to go back to empathic listening. \\n\"Well, I can see some things  you might want to consider.\" \\n   \"Like what, Dad?\" \\n\"Like getting some special help with your re ading.  Maybe they have some kind of tutoring \\nprogram over at the tech school.\" \\n\"I\\'ve already checked into that. It takes two nights and all day Saturday. That would take so \\nmuch time!\" \\nSensing emotion in that reply, the father moves back to empathy. \\n\"That\\'s too much of a price to pay.\" \\n\"Besides, Dad, I told the sixth graders I\\'d be their coach.\" \\n\"You don\\'t want to let them down.\" \\n\"But I\\'ll tell you this, Dad. If I really thought that tutoring course would help, I\\'d be down there \\nevery night. I\\'d get someone else to coach those kids.\" \\n\"You really want the help, but you doubt if the course will make a difference.\" \\n\"Do you think it would, Dad?\" \\nThe son is once more open and logical. He\\'s opening his father\\'s auto biography again.  Now the \\nfather has another opportunity to influence and transform. \\nThere are times when transformation requires no  outside counsel. Often when people are really \\ngiven the chance to open up, they  unravel their own problems and the solutions become clear to them \\nin the process. \\nAt other times, they really need additional pe rspective and help. The key is to genuinely seek the \\nwelfare of the individual, to listen with empathy, to let the person get to the pr oblem and the solution at \\nhis own pace and time. Layer upon layer -- it\\'s lik e peeling an onion until you get to the soft inner \\ncore.

They want to open up. Children desperately want to open up, \\neven more to their parents than to their peers. And they will, if they feel their parents will love them \\nunconditionally and will be faithful to them afterwards and not judge or ridicule them. \\nIf you really seek to understand, without hypo crisy and without guile, there will be times when you \\nwill be literally stunned with the pure knowledge and understanding that will flow to you from another \\nhuman being. It isn\\'t even always necessary to talk  in order to empathize. In fact, sometimes words \\nmay just get in your way. That\\'s one very import ant reason why technique alone will not work. That \\nkind of understanding transcends technique. Isolated technique only gets in the way. \\nI have gone through the skills of  empathic listening because skill is an important part of any habit. \\nWe need to have the skills. But let me reiterate th at the skills will not be effective unless they come \\nfrom a sincere desire to understand. People resent any attempt to manipulate them. In fact, if you\\'re \\ndealing with people you\\'re close to, it\\'s helpful to tell them what you\\'re doing. \\n\"I read this book about listening and empathy and I thought about my rela tionship with you. I \\nrealized I haven\\'t listened to you like I should. But I wa nt to. It\\'s hard for me. I may blow it at times, \\nbut I\\'m going to work at it. I really care about you and I want to understand. I hope you\\'ll help me.\" \\nAffirming your motive is a huge deposit. \\nBut if you\\'re not sincere, I wouldn\\'t even try it . It may create an openness and a vulnerability that \\nwill later turn to your harm when a person discovers that you really didn\\'t care, you really didn\\'t want \\nto listen, and he\\'s left open, exposed, and hurt. The technique, the tip of the iceberg, has to come out of \\nthe massive base of character underneath. \\nNow there are people who protest that empathic listening takes too much time. It may take a little \\nmore time initially but it saves so much time downstream.  The most effici ent thing you can do if \\nyou\\'re a doctor and want to prescribe a wise treatment is to make an accurate di agnosis.  You can\\'t say, \\n\"I\\'m in too much of a hurry. I don\\'t have time to make a diagnosis. Just take this treatment.\" \\nI remember writing one time in a room on the north shore of Oahu, Hawaii. There was a soft \\nbreeze blowing, and so I had opened  two windows -- one at the front an d one at the side -- to keep the \\nroom cool. I had a number of papers laid out, chapter by chapter, on a large table. \\nSuddenly, the breeze started picking up and bl owing my papers about. I remember the frantic \\nsense of loss I felt because things were no longer in order, including unnumb ered pages, and I began \\nrushing around the room trying desperately to put them  back. Finally, I realized it would be better to \\ntake 10 seconds and close one of the windows. \\nEmpathic listening takes time, bu t it doesn\\'t take anywhere near as much time as it takes to back up \\nand correct misunderstandings when you\\'re alread y miles down the road, to redo, to live with \\nunexpressed and unsolved problems, to deal with the results of not giving people psychological air. \\nA discerning empathic listener can read what\\'s  happening down deep fast, and can show such \\nacceptance, such understanding, that other people feel safe to open up layer after layer until they get to \\nthat soft inner core where the problem really lies. \\nPeople want to be understood. And whatever in vestment of time it takes to do that will bring \\nmuch greater returns of time as you work from an  accurate understanding of the problems and issues \\nand from the high Emotional Bank Account that results when a person feels deeply understood. \\nUnderstanding and Perception \\nAs you learn to listen deeply to other pe ople, you will discover tremendous differences in \\nperception. You will also begin to appreciate the impact that these differences can have as people try to work together in interdependent situations. \\nYou see the young woman; I see the ol d lady. And both of us can be right.

And ye t we both have lived with our paradigms for years, \\nthinking they are \"facts,\" and questioning the charac ter or the mental competence of anyone who can\\'t \\n\"see the facts.\" \\nNow, with all our differences, we\\'re trying to  work together -- in a marriage, in a job, in a \\ncommunity service project -- to manage resources and accomplish results. So how do we do it? How \\ndo we transcend the limits of our in dividual perceptions so that we ca n deeply communicate, so that we \\ncan cooperatively deal with the issues and come up with win-win solutions? \\nThe answer is Habit 5. It\\'s the first step in th e process of win-win. Even if (and especially when) \\nthe other person is not coming from th at paradigm, seek first to understand. \\nThis principle worked powerfully for one exec utive who shared with me the following experience. \\n\"I was working with a small company that was in  the process of negotiating a contract with a large \\nnational banking institution. This institution flew in their lawyers from San Francisco, their negotiator \\nfrom Ohio, and presidents of two of  their large banks to create an eight-person negotiating team. The \\ncompany I worked with had decided to go for Win- Win or No Deal. They wanted to significantly \\nincrease the level of service and the cost, but they  had been almost overwhelmed with the demands of \\nthis large financial institution. \\n   \"The president of our company sat across the negotiating table and told them, \\'We would like for \\nyou to write the contract the way you want it so that we can make sure we un derstand your needs and \\nyour concerns. We will respond to those needs and concerns. Then we can talk about pricing.\\' \\n\"The members of the negotiating team were overwhelmed. They were astounded that they were \\ngoing to have the opportunity to write the contract. They took three days to come up with the idea. \\n\"When they presented it, the president said, \\'Now  let\\'s make sure we understand what you want.\\' \\nAnd he went down the contract, rephrasing the conten t, reflecting the feeling, until he was sure and \\nthey were sure he understood what was important to th em.  \\'Yes. That\\'s right.  No, that\\'s not exactly \\nwhat we meant here...yes, you\\'ve got it now.\\' \\n   \"When he thoroughly understood their perspectiv e, he proceeded to explain some concerns from his \\nperspective. . .and they listened.  They were ready to listen. They weren\\'t fighting for air. What \\nhad started out as a very formal, low-trust, almo st hostile atmosphere had turned into a fertile \\nenvironment for synergy. \\n\"At the conclusion of the discussions, the memb ers of the negotiating team  basically said, \\'We want \\nto work with you. We want to do this deal. Just let us know what the price is and we\\'ll sign.\\'\" \\nThen Seek to Be Understood \\nSeek First to Understand, Then to be Understood . Knowing how to be understood is the other half \\nof Habit 5, and is equally critical in reaching win-win solutions. \\nEarlier we defined maturity as the balance be tween courage and consideration.  Seeking to \\nunderstand requires consideration; seeking to be un derstood takes courage. Win-win requires a high \\ndegree of both. So it becomes important in inte rdependent situations for us to be understood. \\nThe early Greeks had a magnificent philosophy which is embodied in three sequentially arranged \\nwords: ethos, pathos, and logos. I suggest these three words contain the esse nce of seeking first to \\nunderstand and making effective presentations. \\nEthos is your personal credibility, the faith peop le have in your integrity and competency. It\\'s the \\ntrust that you inspire, your Emotional Bank Account. Pathos is the empathic side -- it\\'s the feeling. It \\nmeans that you are in alignment with the emotional tr ust of another person\\'s communication. Logos is '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 130}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nthe logic, the reasoning part of the presentation. \\nNotice the sequence: ethos, pathos, logos -- your character, and your rela tionships, and then the \\nlogic of your presentation. This represents anothe r major Paradigm Shift. Most people, in making \\npresentations, go straight to the logos, the left-brain logic, of their ideas. They try to convince other \\npeople of the validity of that logic without firs t taking ethos and pathos into consideration. \\nI had an acquaintance who was very frustrated be cause his boss was locked in to what he felt was an \\nunproductive leadership style. \\n\"Why doesn\\'t he do anything?\" he asked me. \"I\\'v e talked to him about it, he\\'s aware of it, but he \\ndoes nothing.\" \\n\"Well, why don\\'t you make an effective presentation?\" I asked. \\n   \"I did,\"  was the reply. \\n\"How do you define \\'effective\\'? Who do they send back to school when the salesman doesn\\'t sell -- \\nthe buyer? Effective means it works; it means P/ PC. Did you create the change you wanted? Did \\nyou build the relationship in the process? Wh at were the results of your presentation?\" \\n\"I told you, he didn\\'t do anything. He wouldn\\'t listen.\" \\n   \"Then make an effective presentation.  You\\'ve got to empathize with his head. You\\'ve got to get \\ninto his frame of mind. You\\'re got to make your po int simply and visually and describe the alternative \\nhe is in favor of better than he can himself. Th at will take some homework. Are you willing to do \\nthat?\" \\n\"Why do I have to go through all that?\" he asked \\n\"In other words, you want him to change his wh ole leadership style and you\\'re not willing to change \\nyour method of presentation?\" \\n\"I guess so,\" he replied. \\n\"Well, then,\" I said, \"just smile about it and learn to live with it.\" \\n   \"I can\\'t live with it,\"  he said.  \"It compromises my integrity.\" \\n\"Okay, then get to work on an effective pres entation. That\\'s in your Circle of Influence.\" \\nIn the end, he wouldn\\'t do it . The investment seemed too great. \\nAnother acquaintance, a university professor, was willing to pay the price. He approached me one \\nday and said, \"Stephen, I can\\'t get to first base in getting the funding I need for my research because my \\nresearch is really not in the mainstre am of this department\\'s interests.\" \\nAfter discussing his situation at some length, I suggested that he develop an effective presentation \\nusing ethos, pathos, and logos. \"I know you\\'re si ncere and the research you want to do would bring \\ngreat benefits. Describe the alternative they are in favor of better than they can themselves. Show \\nthat you understand them in depth. Then c arefully explain the logic behind your request.\" \\n\"Well, I\\'ll try,\" he said. \\n\"Do you want to practice with me?\" I aske d. He was willing, and so we dress rehearsed his \\napproach. \\nWhen he went in to make his presentation, he started by saying, \"Now let me see if I first \\nunderstand what your objectives are, and what your concerns are about this presentation and my \\nrecommendation.\" \\nHe took the time to do it slowly, gradually. In the middle of his presentation, demonstrating his \\ndepth of understanding and respect for their point of view, a senior professor turned to another \\nprofessor, nodded, turned back to him and said, \"You\\'ve got your money.\" \\nWhen you can present your own ideas clearl y, specifically, visually, and most important, \\ncontextually -- in the context of a deep unders tanding of their paradigms and concerns -- you \\nsignificantly increase the credibility of your ideas.

You \\nreally understand. What you\\'re presenting may ev en be different from what you had originally \\nthought because in your effort to understand, you learned. \\nHabit 5 lifts you to greater accuracy, greater integrity, in your presentations. And people know \\nthat. They know you\\'re presenting the ideas whic h you genuinely believe, taking all known facts and \\nperceptions into consideration, that will benefit everyone. \\nOne-on-One \\nHabit 5 is powerful because it is right in the mi ddle of your Circle of Influence. Many factors in \\ninterdependent situations are in your Circle of  Concern -- problems, disagreements, circumstances, \\nother people\\'s behavior.  And if you focus your energies out there, you deplete them with little \\npositive results. \\nBut you can always seek first to understand. Th at\\'s something that\\'s within your control. And as \\nyou do that, as you focus on your Circle of Influence, you really, deeply understand other people. You \\nhave accurate information to work with, you get to the heart of matters quickly, you build Emotional \\nBank Accounts, and you give people the psycholo gical air they need so you can work together \\neffectively. \\nIt\\'s the Inside-Out approach. And as you do it , watch what happens to your Circle of Influence. \\nBecause you really listen, you become influenceable. And being influenceable is  the key to influencing \\nothers. Your circle begins to expand.  You increase  your ability to influence many of the things in \\nyour Circle of Concern. \\nAnd watch what happens to you. The more de eply you understand other people, the more you \\nwill appreciate them, the more reverent you will feel  about them. To touch the soul of another human \\nbeing is to walk on holy ground. \\nHabit 5 is something you can practice right now. The next time you communicate with anyone, \\nyou can put aside your own autobiography and genuinely seek to understand. Even when people \\ndon\\'t want to open up about their problems, you can be empathic. You can sense their hearts, you can \\nsense the hurt, and you can respond, \"You seem down toda y.\" The y may say nothin g. That\\'s all ri ght. \\nYou\\'ve shown understanding and respect. \\nDon\\'t push; be patient; be respectful. Peopl e  d o n \\' t  h a v e  t o  o p e n  u p  v e r b a l l y  b e f o r e  y o u  c a n \\nempathize. You can empathize all the time with thei r behavior. You can be discerning, sensitive, and \\naware and you can live outside your au tobiography when that is needed. \\nAnd if you\\'re highly proactive, you can create opportunities to do preventive work. You don\\'t \\nh a v e  t o  w a i t  u n t i l  y o u r  s o n  o r  d a u g h t e r  h a s  a  p r o b l e m  w i t h  s c h o o l  o r  y o u  h a v e  y o u r  n e x t  b u s i n e s s \\nnegotiation to seek first to understand. \\nSpend time with your children now, one-on-one. Listen to them; understand them. Look at your \\nhome, at school life, at the challenges and the prob lems they\\'re facing, throug h their eyes. Build the \\nEmotional Bank Account. Give them air. \\nGo out with your spouse on a regular basis. Ha ve dinner or do something together you both enjoy. \\nListen to each other; seek to understand. See life through each other\\'s eyes. \\nMy daily time with Sandra is something I woul dn\\'t trade for anything. As well as seeking to \\nunderstand each other, we often take time to actually practice empathic listening skills to help us in \\ncommunicating with our children. \\nWe often share our different perceptions of  the situation, and we role-play more effective \\napproaches to difficult interpersonal family problems. \\nI may act as if I am a son or daughter requesti ng a special privilege even though I haven\\'t fulfilled a \\nbasic family responsibility, and Sandra plays herself '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 132}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nWe interact back and forth and try to visualize th e situation in a very real way so that we can train \\nourselves to be consistent in modeling and teaching correct principles to our children. Some of our \\nmost helpful role-plays come from redoing a past difficu lt or stressful scene in which one of us \"blew it.\" \\nThe time you invest to deeply understand the pe ople you love brings tremendous dividends in open \\ncommunication. Many of the problems that plague families and marriages simply don\\'t have time to \\nfester and develop.  The communic ation becomes so open that potential problems can be nipped in the \\nbud. And there are great reserves of trust in the Emotional Bank Account to handle the problems that \\ndo arise. \\nIn business, you can set up one-on-one time with your employees. Listen to them, understand \\nthem. Set up human resource accounting or Stakeh older Information Systems in your business to get \\nhonest, accurate feedback at every level:  from  customers, suppliers, and employees.  Make the \\nhuman element as important as the financial or the technical element. You save tremendous amounts \\nof time, energy, and money when you tap into the hu man resources of a business at every level. When \\nyou listen, you learn. And you also give the people who work for you and with you psychological air. You inspire loyalty that goes well beyond the eight-to-five physical demands of the job. \\n   Seek first to understand.  Before the problems come up, before you try to evaluate and prescribe, \\nbefore you try to present your own ideas -- seek to understand. It\\'s a powerful habit of effective \\ninterdependence. \\nWhen we really, deeply understand each other, we open the door to creative solutions and Third \\nAlternatives. Our differences are no longer st umbling blocks to communication and progress. \\nInstead, they become the st epping stones to synergy. \\nApplication Suggestions \\n1. Select a relationship in which you sense th e Emotional Bank Account is in the red. Try to \\nunderstand and write down the situation from the other person\\'s point of view.  In your next \\ninteraction, listen for understanding, comparing wh at you are hearing with what you wrote down. \\nHow valid were your assumptions? Did you really understand that individual\\'s perspective. \\n2. Share the concept of empathy with someone cl ose to you. Tell him or her you want to work on \\nreally listening to others and ask for feedback in  a week. How did you do? How did it make that \\nperson feel. \\n3. The next time you have an opportunity to watch people communicate, cover your ears for a few \\nminutes and just watch. What emotions are bein g communicated that may not come across in words \\nalone. \\n4. Next time you catch yourself inappropriat ely using one of the auto biographical responses -\\xad\\nprobing, evaluating, advising, or interpreting -- try to turn the situation into a deposit by acknowledgment and apology. (\"I\\'m sorry, I just rea lized I\\'m not really trying to understand. Could \\nwe start again?\") \\n5. Base your next presentation on empathy. Describe the other point of view as well as or better \\nthan its proponents; then seek to have your point understood from their frame of reference. \\nHabit 6:  Synergize TM \\nPrinciples of Creative Cooperation '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 133}, page_content=\"T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nI take as my guide the hope of a saint \\nin crucial things, unity --\\nin important things, diversity --\\n   in all things, generosity \\n-- Inaugural Address of President George Bus \\n*  * \\nWhen Sir Winston Churchill was called to head up the war effort for Great Britain, he remarked that \\nall his life had prepared him for this hour. In a simi lar sense, the exercise of all of the other habits \\nprepares us for the habit of synergy. \\nWhen properly understood, synergy is the highest activity in all life -- the true test and \\nmanifestation of all the other habits put together. \\nThe highest forms of synergy focus the four unique human endowments, the motive of win-win, \\nand the skills of empathic communication on the toug hest challenges we face in life. What results is \\nalmost miraculous. We create new alternat ives -- something that wasn't there before. \\nSynergy is the essence of Principle-Centered Lead ership. It is the essence of principle-centered \\nparenting. It catalyzes, unifies, and unleashes th e greatest powers within people. All the habits we \\nhave covered prepare us to create the miracle of synergy. \\nWhat is synergy? Simply defined, it means that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. It \\nmeans that the relationship which the parts have to each other is a part in and of itself. It is not only a \\npart, but the most catalytic, the most empowering,  the most unifying, and the most exciting part. \\nThe creative process is also the most terrifying part because you don't know exactly what's going to \\nhappen or where it is going to lead. You don't know what new dangers and challenges you'll find. It \\ntakes an enormous amount of internal security to be gin with the spirit of adventure, the spirit of \\ndiscovery, the spirit of creativity. Without doubt, you have to leave the comfort zone of base camp \\nand confront an entirely new and unknown wilderne ss. You become a trailblazer, a pathfinder. You \\nopen new possibilities, new territories, new continents, so that others can follow. \\nSynergy is everywhere in nature. If you plan t two plants close together, the roots commingle and \\nimprove the quality of the soil so that both plants will grow better than if they were separated. If you \\nput two pieces of wood together, they will hold mu ch more than the total of  the weight held by each \\nseparately. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. One plus one equals three or more. \\nThe challenge is to apply the principles of crea tive cooperation, which we learn from nature, in our \\nsocial interactions. Family life provides many o pportunities to observe synergy and to practice it. \\nThe very way that man and a woman bring a child  into the world is synergistic. The essence of \\nsynergy is to value differences -- to respect them, to  build on strengths, to compensate for weaknesses. \\nWe obviously value the physical differences between men and women, husbands and wives. But \\nwhat about the social, mental, and emotional differences? Could these differences not also be sources of \\ncreating new exciting forms of life -- creating an envi ronment that is truly fulf illing for each person, that \\nnurtures the self-esteem and self-worth to each, th at creates opportunities for each to mature into \\nindependence and then gradually into interdepende nce? Could synergy not create a new script for the \\nnext generation -- one that is more geared to serv ice and contribution, and is less protective, less \\nadversarial, less selfish; one that is more open, mo re giving, and is less defensive, protective, and \\npolitical; one that is more loving, more c aring, and is less possessive and judgmental? \\nSynergistic Communication \\n   When you communicate synergistically, yo u are simply opening yo ur mind and heart and \\nexpressions to new possibilities, new alternatives, new options. It may seem as if you are casting aside \\nHabit 2 (to Begin with the End in Mind); but, in fact, you're doing the opposite -- you're fulfilling it. \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 134}, page_content=\"T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nYou're not sure when you engage in synergistic co mmunication how things will work out or what the \\nend will look like, but you do have an inward sense of excitement and security and adventure, believing \\nthat it will be significantly bette r than it was before. And that is  the end that you have in mind. \\nYou begin with the belief that parties involved will  gain more insight, and th at the excitement of that \\nmutual learning and insigh t will create a momentum toward mo re and more insights, learning, and \\ngrowth. \\nMany people have not really experienced even a moderate degree of synergy in  their family life or in \\nother interactions. They've been trained and scripte d into defensive and protective communications or \\ninto believing that life or other people can't be trusted. As a result, they are never really open to Habit \\n6 and to these principles. \\nThis represents one of the great tragedies and wastes in life, because so  much potential remains \\nuntapped -- completely undeveloped and unused. In effective people live day after day with unused \\npotential. They experience synergy only in  small, peripheral ways in their lives. \\nThey may have memories of some unusual creati ve experiences, perhaps in athletics, where they \\nwere involved in a real team spirit for a period of time. Or perhaps they were in an emergency situation where people cooperated to an unusually  high degree and submerged ego and pride in an \\neffort to save someone's life or to produce a solution to a crisis. \\nTo many, such events may seem  unusual, almost out of character with life, even miraculous. But \\nthis is not so. These things can be produced regul arly, consistently, almost daily in people's lives. \\nBut it requires enormous personal securi ty and openness and a spirit of adventure. \\nAlmost all creative endeavors are somewhat unpredictable. They often seem ambiguous, \\nhit-or-miss, trial and error. And unless people have a high tolerance for ambiguity and get their \\nsecurity from integrity to principles and inner valu es they find it unnerving and unpleasant to be \\ninvolved in highly creative enterprises. Their need  for structure, certainty, and predictability is too \\nhigh. \\nSynergy in the Classroom \\nAs a teacher, I have come to believe that many tr uly great classes teeter on the very edge of chaos. \\nSynergy tests whether teachers and students are really  open to the principle of  the whole being greater \\nthan the sum of its parts. \\nThere are times when neither the teacher nor the student know for sure what's going to happen. In \\nthe beginning, there's a safe environment that enables people to be really open and to learn and to listen to each other's ideas. Then come s brainstorming where the spirit of evaluation is subordinated to the \\nspirit of creativity, imagining, and intellectual ne tworking.  Then an absolu tely unusual phenomenon \\nbegins to take place. The entire class is transfor med with the excitement of a new thrust, a new idea, a \\nnew direction that's hard to define, yet it's  almost palpable to the people involved. \\nSynergy is almost as if a group collectively agr ees to subordinate old scripts and to write a new one. \\nI'll never forget a university class I taught in le adership philosophy and style. We were about three \\nweeks into a semester when, in the middle of a presen tation, one person started  to relate some very \\npowerful personal experiences which were both emotional and insightful. A spirit of humility and \\nreverence fell upon the class -- reverence toward th is individual and appreciation for his courage. \\nThis spirit became fertile soil for a synergistic and creative endeavor. Others began to pick up on it, \\nsharing some of their experiences an d insights and even some of their self-doubts. The spirit of trust \\nand safety prompted many to become extremely open. Rather than present what they prepared, they \\nfed on each other's insights and ideas and started to  create a whole new scenari o as to what that class \\ncould mean. \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 135}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nI was deeply involved in the process. In fact, I was almost mesmerized by it because it seemed so \\nmagical and creative. And I found myself gradually loosening up my commitment to the structure of \\nthe class and sensing entirely new possibilities. It wa sn\\'t just a flight of fancy; there was a sense of \\nmaturity and stability and substance which transcended by far the old structure and plan. \\nWe abandoned the old syllabus, the purchased te xtbooks, and all the presentation plans, and we set \\nup new purposes and projects and assignments. We became so excited ab out what was happening \\nthat in about three more weeks, we all sensed an overwhelming desire to share what was happening \\nwith others \\nWe decided to write a book containing our le arnings and insights on the subject of our study -- \\nprinciples of leadership. Assignments were chan ged, new projects undertaken, new teams formed. \\nPeople worked much harder than they ever would ha ve in the original class structure, and for an \\nentirely different set of reasons \\nOut of this experience emerged an extremely un ique, cohesive, and synergistic culture that did not \\nend with the semester. For years, alumni meetings  were held among members of that class. Even \\ntoday, many years later, when we see each other, we talk about it and often attempt to describe what \\nhappened and why. \\n   One of the interesting things to me was how little time had transp ired before there was sufficient \\ntrust to create such synergy. I think it was larg ely because the people were relatively mature. They \\nwere in the final semester of their senior year, and I think they wanted more than just another good \\nclassroom experience. They were hungry for some thing new and exciting, something that they could \\ncreate that was truly meaningful. It was \"an idea  whose time had come\" for them. In addition, the \\nchemistry was right. I felt that experiencing sy nergy was more powerful than  talking about it, that \\nproducing something new was more meaning ful than simply reading something old. \\nI\\'ve also experienced, as I believe most people  have, times that were almost  synergistic, times that \\nhung on the edge of chaos and for some reason desce nded into it. Sadly, people who are burned by \\nsuch experiences often begin their next new experi e n c e  w i t h  t h a t  f a i l u r e  i n  m i n d .   T h e y  d e f e n d \\nthemselves against it and cut themselves off from synergy. \\nIt\\'s like administrators who set up new rules an d regulations based on the abuses of a few people \\ninside an organization, thus limiting the freedom and creative possibilities for many -- or business \\npartners who imagine the worst scenarios possible and write them up in legal language, killing the \\nwhole spirit of creativity, enterprise, and synergistic possibility. \\nAs I think back on many consulting and ex ecutive education experiences, I can say that the \\nhighlights were almost always synergistic.  Th ere was usually an early moment that required \\nconsiderable courage, perhaps in becoming extremely authentic, in confronting some inside truth about \\nthe individual or the organization or  the family which really needed to be said, but took a combination \\nof considerable courage and genuine love to say it .  Then others became mo re authentic, open, and \\nhonest, and the synergistic communication process bega n. It usually became more and more creative, \\nand ended up in insights and plans th at no one had anticipated initially. \\nAs Carl Rogers taught, \"That which is most personal is most general.\"  The more authentic you \\nbecome, the more genuine in your expression, part icularly regarding personal experiences and even \\nself-doubts, the more people can relate to your expression and the safer it makes them feel to express \\nthemselves. That expression in turn feeds back on the other person\\'s spir it, and genuine creative \\nempathy takes place, producing new insights and le arnings and a sense of excitement and adventure \\nthat keeps the process going. \\n   People then begin to interact wi th each other almost in half sent ences, sometimes incoherently, but \\nthey get each other\\'s meanings ve ry rapidly. Then whole new worlds of insights, new perspectives, \\nnew paradigms that insure options, new alternativ es are opened up and th ought about.

Almost all members of the company went \\nhigh up into the mountains where, surrounded by th e magnificence of nature, we began with a first \\ndraft of what some of us considered to be an excellent mission statement. \\nAt first the communication was respectful, carefu l and predictable.  But as  we began to talk about \\nthe various alternatives, possibilities, and opportunit ies ahead, people became very open and authentic \\nand simply started to think out lo ud. The mission statement agenda gave way to a collective free \\nassociation, a spontaneous piggyb acking of ideas.  People were genuinely empathic as well as \\ncourageous, and we moved from mutual respec t and understanding to creative synergistic \\ncommunication. \\n   Everyone could sense it.  It was exciting.  As it matured, we returned to the task of putting the \\nevolved collective vision into words, each of wh ich contains specific an d committed-to meaning for \\neach participant. \\nThe resulting corporate mission statement reads: \\nOur Mission is to empower people and organizat ions to significantly increase their performance \\ncapability in order to achieve worthwhile purposes through understanding and living \\nPrinciple-Centered Leadership. \\nThe synergistic process that led to the creation of our mission statement eng raved it in all the hearts \\nand minds of everyone there, and it has served us well as a frame of reference of what we are about, as \\nwell as what we are not about. \\nAnother high-level synergy experience took plac e when I accepted an invi tation to serve as the \\nresource and discussion catalyst at the annual planni ng meeting of a large insurance company. Several \\nmonths ahead, I met with the committee responsibl e to prepare for and stage the two-day meeting \\nwhich was to involve all the top executives. They informed me that the t raditional pattern was to \\nidentify four or five major issues through questionnaires and interviews, and to have alternative proposals presented by the executives. Past meet ings had been generally respectful exchanges, \\noccasionally deteriorating into defensive win-lo se ego battles.  They were usually predictable, \\nuncreative, and boring. \\nAs I talked with the committee members about the power of synergy, they could sense its potential. \\nWith considerable trepidation, they agreed to chan ge the pattern. They requested various executives \\nto prepare anonymous \"white papers\" on each of the high priority issues, and then asked all the \\nexecutives to immerse themselves in these papers ah ead of time in order to understand the issues and \\nthe differing points of view. They were to come to the meeting prepared to listen rather than to \\npresent, prepared to create and synergiz e rather than to defend and protect. \\nWe spent the first half-day in the meeting teaching  the principles and practici ng the skills of Habits 4, \\n5, and 6. The rest of the time was spent in creative synergy. \\nThe release of creative energy was incredible. Excitement replaced boredom. People became very \\nopen to each other\\'s influence and generated new insi ghts and options. By the end of the meeting an \\nentirely new understanding of the nature of the ce ntral company challenge ev olved.  The white paper \\nproposals became obsolete.  Differences were valu ed and transcended.  A new common vision began \\nto form. \\nOnce people have experienced real synergy, th ey are never quite the same again. They know the \\npossibility of having other such mind-expanding adventures in the future. \\nOften attempts are made to recreate a particular synergistic experience, but this seldom can be done. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 137}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nHowever, the essential purpose behind creative wo rk can be recaptured.  Like the Far Eastern \\nphilosophy, \"We seek not to imitate the masters, rather we seek what they sought,\" we seek not to \\nimitate past creative synergistic experiences, rat her we seek new ones around new and different and \\nsometimes higher purposes. \\nSnergy and Communication \\n   Synergy is exciting.  Creativity is exciting. It\\'s phenomenal what openness and communication \\ncan produce. The possibilities of truly significant gain , of significant improvemen t are so real that it\\'s \\nworth the risk such openness entails. \\nAfter World War II, the United States commiss ioned David Lilienthal to head the new Atomic \\nEnergy Commission. Lilienthal brought together a gr oup of people who were highly influential -\\xad\\ncelebrities in their own right -- disciples, as it were, of their own frames of reference. \\nThis very diverse group of individuals had an extremely heavy agenda, and they were impatient to \\nget at it. In addition, the press was pushing them. \\nBut Lilienthal took several weeks to create a high Emotional Bank Account. He had these people \\nget to know each other -- their interests, their hopes,  their goals, their concerns, their backgrounds, their \\nframes of reference, their paradigms. He facilitated  the kind of human interaction that creates a great \\nbonding between people, and he was heavily criticized for taking the time to do it because it wasn\\'t \\n\"efficient.\" \\nBut the net result was that this  group became closely knit together, very open with each other, very \\ncreative, and synergistic. The respect among the me mbers of the commission was so high that if there \\nwas disagreement, instead of opposition and defense,  there was a genuine effo rt to understand. The \\nattitude was \"If a person of your intelligence and competence and commitment disagrees with me, then \\nthere must be something to your disagreement that I don\\'t understand, and I need to understand it. \\nYou have a perspective, a frame of reference I need to look at.\" Nonprotectiv e interaction developed, \\nand an unusual culture was born. \\nThe following diagram illustrates how closely trus t is related to different levels of communication. \\nThe lowest level of communication coming out of low-trust situations would be characterized by \\ndefensiveness, protectiveness, and often legalistic la nguage, which covers all the bases and spells out \\nqualifiers and the escape clauses in the event thin gs go sour. Such communication produces only \\nwin-lose or lose-lose. It isn\\'t effective -- there\\' s no P/PC Balance -- and it creates further reasons to \\ndefend and protect. \\nThe middle position is respectful communication. This is the level where fairly mature people \\ninteract. They have respect for each other, but they want to avoid the possibility of ugly confrontations, so they communicate politely but not empathically. They might understand each other intellectually, \\nbut they really don\\'t deeply look at the paradigms  and assumptions underlying  their own opinions and \\nbecome open to new possibilities. \\nRespectful communication works in independent situations and even in interdependent situations, \\nbut the creative possibilities are not opened up. In interdependent situations compromise is the \\nposition usually taken.  Compromise means that 1 + 1 + 1 = 1/2. Both give and take.  The \\ncommunication isn\\'t defensive or pr otective or angry or manipulative ; it is honest and genuine and \\nrespectful. But it isn\\'t creative or synergis tic. It produces a low form of win-win. \\nSynergy means that 1 + 1 may equal 8, 16, or even 1,600. The synergistic position of high trust \\nproduces solutions better than any originally propos ed, and all parties know it. Furthermore, they \\ngenuinely enjoy the creative enterprise. A miniculture is  formed to satisfy in and of itself. Even if it \\nis short-lived, the P/PC Balance is there.

But \\neven in these circumstances, the spirit of sincer e trying will usually result in a more effective \\ncompromise. \\nFishing for the A Third Alternative \\nTo get a better idea of how our level of communication affects our interdependent effectiveness, \\nenvision the following scenario. \\nIt\\'s vacation time, and a husband wants to take his family out to the lake country to enjoy camping \\nand fishing. This is important to him; he\\'s been planning it all year. He\\'s made reservations at a \\ncottage on the lake and arranged to rent a boat, and his sons are really excited about going. \\nHis wife, however, wants to use the vacation time  to visit her ailing mother some 250 miles away. \\nShe doesn\\'t have the opportunity to see her very often, and this is important to her \\nTheir differences could be the ca use of a major negative experience. \\n\"The plans are set. The boys are excited. We should go on the fishing trip,\" he says. \\n\"But we don\\'t know how much longer my mother  will be around, and I want to be by her,\" she \\nreplies. \"This is our only opportuni ty to have enough time to do that.\" \\n\"All year long we\\'ve looked forward to this one-week vacation. The boys would be miserable \\nsitting around grandmother\\'s house for a week. They\\'d drive everybody crazy.  Besides, your \\nmother\\'s not that sick. And she has your sister  less than a mile away to take care of her.\" \\n\"She\\'s my mother, too. I want to be with her.\" \\n   \"You could phone her every night.  And we\\'re planning to spend time with her at the Christmas \\nfamily reunion.  Remember?\"\\n   \"That\\'s not for five more months.  We don\\'t even  know if she\\'ll still be here by then. Besides, she \\nneeds me, and she wants me.\" \\n\"She\\'s being well taken care of. Besides, the boys and I need you, too.\" \\n\"My mother is more important than fishing.\" \\n\"Your husband and sons are mo re important than your mother.\" \\nAs they disagree, back and forth, they finally may come up with some kind of compromise. They \\nmay decide to split up -- he takes the boys fishing at the lake while she visits her mother. And they \\nboth feel guilty and unhappy. The boys sense it, and it affects their enjoyment of the vacation. \\nThe husband may give in to his wife, but he does  it grudgingly. And consciously or unconsciously, \\nhe produces evidence to fulfill his prophecy of how miserable the week will be for everyone. \\nThe wife may give in to her husband, bu t she\\'s withdrawn and overreactive to any new \\ndevelopments in her mother\\'s health  situation. If her mother were to become seriously ill and die, the \\nhusband could never forgive himself, and she couldn\\'t forgive him either. \\nWhatever compromise they finally agree on, it could be rehearsed over the years as evidence of \\ninsensitivity, neglect, or a bad priority decision on ei ther part. It could be a source of contention for \\nyears and could even polarize the family. Many marriages that once were beautiful and soft and \\nspontaneous and loving have deteriorated to the level of a hostility through a seri es of incidents just like \\nthis. \\nThe husband and wife see the situation differently.  And that di fference can polarize them, separate \\nthem, create wedges in the relationship. Or it can bring them closer together on a higher level. If they have cultivated the habits of  effective interdependence, they approach their differences from an \\nentirely different paradigm. Their co mmunication is on a higher level. \\nBecause they have a high Emotional Bank Account, they have trust and open communication in \\ntheir marriage. Because they Think Win-Win, they believe in a Third Alternative, a solution that is \\nmutually beneficial and is better than what either of them originally proposed. Because they listen '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 139}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nempathically and seek first to understand, they  create within themselves and between them a \\ncomprehensive picture of the values and the concerns that need to be taken in to account in making a \\ndecision. \\nAnd the combination of those ingredients -- th e high Emotional Bank Account, thinking win-win, \\nand seeking first to understand -- creates the ideal environment for synergy. \\nBuddhism calls this \"the middle way.\" Middle in  this sense does not me an compromise; it means \\nhigher, like the apex of the triangle. \\nIn searching for the \"middle\" or higher way, this husband and wife realize that their love, their \\nrelationship, is part of their synergy \\nAs they communicate, the husband really, deeply  feels his wife\\'s desire, her need to be with her \\nmother. He understands how she wants to relieve her sister, who has had the primary responsibility \\nfor their mother\\'s care. He understands that they really don\\'t know how long she will be with them, \\nand that she certainly is mo re important than fishing. \\nAnd the wife deeply understands her husband\\'s de sire to have the family together and to provide a \\ngreat experience for the boys. She realizes the investment that has been made in lessons and \\nequipment to prepare for this fishing vacation, and sh e feels the importance of creating good memories \\nwith them. \\nSo they pool those desires. And they\\'re not on opposite sides of the problem. They\\'re together on \\none side, looking at the problem, understanding the needs, and working to cr eate a Third Alternative \\nthat will meet them. \\n\"Maybe we could arrange another time within the month for you to visit with your mother,\" he \\nsuggests. \"I could take over the home responsib ilities for the weekend and arrange for some help at \\nthe first of the week so that you could go. I know it\\'s important to you to have that time. \\n\"Or maybe we could locate a place to camp and fi sh that would be close to your mother. The area \\nwouldn\\'t be as nice, but we could still be outdoor s and meet other needs as well.  And the boys \\nwouldn\\'t be climbing the walls. We could even plan  some recreational activities with the cousins, \\naunts, and uncles, which would be an added benefit.\" \\n   They synergize.  They communicate back and fo rth until they come up with a solution they both \\nfeel good about. It\\'s better than the solutions eith er of them originally proposed. It\\'s better than \\ncompromise. It\\'s a synergistic solution that builds P and PC. \\nInstead of a transaction, it\\'s a transformation. They get what they both really want and build their \\nrelationship in the process. \\nNegative Synergy \\n   Seeking the Third Alternative is  a major Paradigm Shift from the di chotomous, either/or mentality. \\nBut look at the difference in results. \\nHow much negative energy is typically expend ed when people try to solve problems or make \\ndecisions in an interdependent reality? How much time is spent in confessing other people\\'s sins, \\npoliticking, rivalry, interpersonal conflict, protec ting one\\'s backside, masterminding, and second \\nguessing? It\\'s like trying to drive down the road wi th one foot on the gas and the other foot on the \\nbrake. \\nAnd instead of getting a foot off the brake, most people give it more gas. They try to apply more \\npressure, more eloquence, more logical in formation to strength en their position. \\nThe problem is that highly dependent people are trying to succeed in an interdependent reality. \\nThey\\'re either dependent on borrowing strength fr om position power and they go for win-lose or \\nthey\\'re dependent on being popular with others an d they go for lose-win. They may talk win-win \\ntechnique, but they don\\'t really wa nt to listen; they want to manipu late. And synergy can\\'t thrive in '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 140}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nthat environment. \\nInsecure people think that all reality should be amenable to their paradigms. They have a high \\nneed to clone others, to mold them  over into their own thinking. They don\\'t realize that the very \\nstrength of the relationship is in having another po int of view. Sameness is not oneness; uniformity is \\nnot unity. Unity, or oneness, is complement ariness, not sameness.  Sameness is uncreative...and \\nboring. The essence of synergy is to value the differences. \\nI\\'ve come to believe that the key to interperso nal synergy is intrapersonal synergy, that is synergy \\nwithin ourselves. The heart of interpersonal syner gy is embodied in the prin ciples in the first three \\nhabits, which give the internal security sufficient to handle the risks of being open and vulnerable.  By \\ninternalizing those principles, we develop the Abunda nce Mentality of win-win and the authenticity of \\nHabit 5. \\nOne of the very practical results of being prin ciple-centered is that it makes us whole -- truly \\nintegrated. People who are scripted deeply in logi cal, verbal, left-brain thinking will discover how \\ntotally inadequate that thinking is in solving proble ms which require a great deal of creativity. They \\nbecome aware and begin to open up a new script inside  their right brain. It\\'s not that the right brain \\nwasn\\'t there; it just lay dormant. The muscles ha d not been developed, or perhaps they had atrophied \\nafter early childhood because of the heavy left-brain emphasis of formal education or social scripting. \\nWhen a person has access to bo th the intuitive, creative, and visu al right brain, and the analytical, \\nlogical, verbal left brain, then the whole brain is working. In other words, there is psychic synergy \\ntaking place in our own head. And th is tool is best suited to the rea lity of what life is, because life is \\nnot just logical -- it is also emotional. \\nOne day I was presenting a seminar which I titled , \"Manage from the Left, Le ad from the Right\" to a \\ncompany in Orlando, Florida. During the break, the president of the company came up to me and said, \\n\"Stephen, this is intriguing.  But I have been th inking about this material  more in terms of its \\napplication to my marriage than to my business. My wife and I have a real communication problem. \\nI wonder if you would have lunch with the two of us and just kind of watch how we talk to each other? \\n\"Let\\'s do it,\" I replied. \\nAs we sat down together, we exchanged a few pleasantries.  Then this man turned to his wife and \\nsaid, \"Now, honey, I\\'ve invited Stephen to have lunch with us to see if he  could help us in our \\ncommunication with each other. I know you feel I should be a more sensitive, considerate husband. \\nCould you give me something specific  you think I ought to do?\" His do minant left brain wanted facts, \\nfigures, specifics, parts. \\n   \" W e l l ,  a s  I \\' v e  t o l d  y o u  b e f o re, it\\'s nothing specific.  It\\'s mo re of a general sense I have about \\npriorities.\" Her dominant right brain was dealing wi th sensing and with the gestalt, the whole, the \\nrelationship between the parts. \\n\"What do you mean, \\'a general feeling about prio r i t i e s \\' ?  W h a t  i s  i t  y o u  w a n t  m e  t o  d o ?  G i v e  m e \\nsomething specific I can get a handle on.\" \\n\"Well, it\\'s just a feeling.\" Her right brain was dea ling in images, intuitive feelings. \"I just don\\'t think \\nour marriage is as important to you as you tell me it is.\" \\n\"Well, what can I do to make it more important?  Give me something concrete and specific to go on.\" \\n\"It\\'s hard to put into words.\" \\nAt that point, he just rolled his eyes and looked at me as if to say, \"Stephen, could you endure this \\nkind of dumbness in your marriage?\" \\n\"It\\'s just a feeling,\" she said, \"a very strong feeling.\" \\n\"Honey,\" he said to her, \"that\\'s your problem. And that\\'s the problem with  your mother. In fact, \\nit\\'s the problem with every woman I know.\" \\nThen he began to interrogate her as though it were some kind of legal deposition. \\n\"Do you live where you want to live?\" '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 141}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\n\"That\\'s not it,\" she sighed. \"That\\'s not it at all.\" \\n\"I know,\" he replied with a forced patience. \"But since you won\\'t tell me exactly what it is, I figure \\nthe best way to find out what it is is to find out what it is not. Do you live where you want to live?\" \\n   \"I guess.\" \\n   \"Honey, Stephen\\'s here for just a few minutes to try to help us. Just give me a quick \\'yes\\' or \\'no\\' \\nanswer. Do you live where you want to live?\" \\n   \" Y e s . \" \\n\"Okay. That\\'s settled. Do you have the things you want to have?\" \\n   \" Y e s . \" \\n\"All right. Do you do the things you want to do?\" \\nThis went on for a little while, an d I could see I wasn\\'t helping at a ll. So I intervened and said, \"Is \\nthis kind of how it goes in your relationship?\" \\n\"Every day, Stephen,\" he replied. \\n\"It\\'s the story of our marriage,\" she sighed. \\nI looked at the two of them and the though t crossed my mind that they were two half-brained \\npeople living together. \"Do yo u have any children?\" I asked. \\n   \"Yes, two.\" \\n\"Really?\" I asked incredulously. \"How did you do it?\" \\n\"What do you mean how did we do it?\" \\n\"You were synergistic!\" I said. \"One plus one usually equals two. But you made one plus one \\nequal four. Now that\\'s synergy. The whole is grea ter than the sum of the parts. So how did you do \\nit?\" \\n\"You know how we did it,\" he replied. \\n\"You must have valued the differences!\" I exclaimed. \\nValuing the Differences \\nValuing the differences is the essence of syne rgy -- the mental, the emotional, the psychological \\ndifferences between people. And the key to valuing th ose differences is to realize that all people see \\nthe world, not as it is, but as they are. \\nIf I think I see the world as it is, why would I want to value the differences? Why would I even want \\nto bother with someone who\\'s \"off t rack\"? My paradigm is that I am objective; I see the world as it is. \\nEveryone else is buried by the minutia, but I see the larger picture.  That\\'s why they call me a \\nsupervisor -- I have super vision. \\nIf that\\'s my paradigm, then I will never be  effectively interdependent, or even effectively \\nindependent, for that matter. I will be limited by the paradigms of my own conditioning. \\nThe person who is truly effective has the hum ility and reverence to recognize his own perceptual \\nlimitations and to appreciate the rich resources available through interaction with the hearts and minds \\nof other human beings.  That person values the differences because those differences add to his \\nknowledge, to his understanding of reality. When  we\\'re left to our own experiences, we constantly \\nsuffer from a shortage of data. \\n   Is it lo gical that two people can disa gree and that both can be ri ght? It\\'s not lo gical: it\\'s ps ycholo gical. \\nAnd it\\'s very real. You see the young lady; I see the old woman. We\\'re both looking at the same \\npicture, and both of us are right. We see th e same black lines, the same white spaces.  But we \\ninterpret them differently because we\\'ve been  conditioned to interpret them differently. \\n   And unless we value the differences in our pe rceptions, unless we value each other and give \\ncredence to the possibility that we\\'re both right, th at life is not always a dichotomous either/or, that \\nthere are almost always Third Alternatives, we will never be able to transcend the limits of that '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 142}, page_content='I T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nconditioning. \\nAll I may see is the old woman. But I realize that you see something else. And I value you. \\nvalue your perception. I want to understand. \\nSo when I become aware of the difference in our perceptions, I say, \"Good! You see it differently! \\nHelp me see what you see.\" \\nIf two people have the same opinion, one is unne cessary. It\\'s not going to do me any good at all to \\ncommunicate with someone else who sees only th e old woman also.  I do n\\'t want to talk, to \\ncommunicate, with someone who agrees with me; I want to communicate with you because you see it \\ndifferently. I value that difference. \\nBy doing that, I not only incr ease my own awareness; I also affirm  you. I give you psychological \\nair. I take my foot off the brake and release the ne gative energy you may have invested in defending a \\nparticular position. I create an environment for synergy. \\nThe importance of valuing the difference is captured in an often-quoted fable called \"The Animal \\nSchool,\" written by educator Dr. R. H. Reeves. \\nOnce upon a time, the animals decided they must  do something heroic to meet the problems of a \\n\"New World,\" so they organized a school. They adop ted an activity curriculum consisting of running, \\nclimbing, swimming, and flying. To make it easier  to administer, all animals took all the subjects. \\nThe duck was excellent in swimming, better in fa ct than his instructor, and made excellent grades in \\nflying, but he was very poor in running. Since he was low in running he had to stay after school and \\nalso drop swimming to practice running. This was kept up until his web feet were badly worn and he \\nwas only average in swimming. But average was ac ceptable in school, so nobody worried about that \\nexcept the duck. \\nThe rabbit started at the top of the class in running, but had a nervous breakdown because of so \\nmuch makeup in swimming. \\nThe squirrel was excellent in climbing until he developed frustrations in the flying class where his \\nteacher made him start from the ground up instea d of from the tree-top down. He also developed \\ncharley horses from over-exertion and he got a C in climbing and a D in running. \\nThe eagle was a problem child and had to be discip lined severely. In climbing class he beat all the \\nothers to the top of the tree, but insisted on using his own way of getting there. \\nAt the end of the year, an abnormal eel that co uld swim exceedingly well and also could run, climb \\nand fly a little had the highest average and was valedictorian. \\nThe prairie dogs stayed out of school and fought  the tax levy because the administration would not \\nadd digging and burrowing to the curriculum. They apprenticed their children to the badger and later \\njoined the groundhogs and gophers to start a successful private school. \\nForce Field Analysis \\nIn an interdependent situation, synergy is part icularly powerful in dealing with negative forces that \\nwork against growth and change. \\nSociologist Kurt Lewin developed a \"Force Field Analysis\" model in which he described any current \\nlevel of performance or being as a state of equ ilibrium between the driving forces that encourage \\nupward movement and the restraining forces that discourage it. \\nDriving forces generally are positive, reasonable, logical, conscious, and economic. In juxtaposition, \\nrestraining forces are often negative , emotional, illogical, unconscious, and social/psychological. Both \\nsets of forces are very real and must be taken into account in dealing with change. \\nIn a family, for example, you have a certain \"cli mate\" in the home -- a cert ain level of positive or \\nnegative interaction, of feeling safe or unsafe in expr essing feelings or talking about concerns, of respect \\nor disrespect in communication among family members. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 143}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nYou may really want to change that level. You may want to create a climate that is more positive, \\nmore respectful, more open and trusting. Your lo gical reasons for doing that are the driving forces \\nthat act to raise the level.. \\nBut increasing those driving forces is not enough . Your efforts are opposed by restraining forces --\\nby the competitive spirit between children in the fam ily, by the different scripting of home life you and \\nyour spouse have brought to the relationship, by habits that have developed in the family, by work or \\nother demands on your time and energies. \\nIncreasing the driving forces may bring results -- for a while. But as long as the restraining forces \\nare there, it becomes increasingly harder. It\\'s lik e pushing against a spring: the harder you push, the \\nharder it is to push until the force of th e spring suddenly thrusts the level back down. \\nThe resulting up and down, yo-y o effect causes you to feel, after several attempts, that people are \\n\"just the way they are\" and that \"it\\'s too difficult to change.\" \\nBut when you introduce synergy, you use th e motive of Habit 4, the skill of Habit 5, and the \\ninteraction of Habit 6 to work directly on the rest raining forces. You unfreeze them, loosen them up, \\nand create new insights that actually transform those restraining forces into driving ones. You involve people in the problem, immerse them in it, so that they soak it in an d feel it is their problem and they \\ntend to become an important part of the solution. \\nAs a result, new goals, shared goals, are create d, and the whole enterprise moves upward, often in \\nways that no one could have anticipated. And the excitement contained within that movement creates \\na new culture. The people involved in it are en meshed in each other\\'s humanity and empowered by \\nnew, fresh thinking, by new creative  alternatives and opportunities. \\nI\\'ve been involved several times in negotiatio ns between people who were angry at each other and \\nhired lawyers to defend their positions. And all that did was to exacerbate the problem because the \\ninterpersonal communication deteriorated as it went through the legal process. But the trust level was \\nso low that the parties felt they had no other alternative than to take the issues to court. \\n\"Would you be interested in going for a win-win so lution that both parties feel really good about?\" I \\nwould ask. \\nThe response was usually affirmative, but mo st people didn\\'t really think it was possible. \\n\"If I can get the other party to agree, would you be willing to start the process of really \\ncommunicating with each other?\" \\nAgain, the answer was usually \"yes.\" \\nThe results in almost every case have been astounding.  Problems that had been legally and \\npsychologically wrangled about for months have been settled in a matter of a few hours or days. Most \\nof the solutions weren\\'t the courthouse compromise solutions either; they were synergistic, better than \\nthe solutions proposed independently by either party.   And, in most cases, the relationships continued \\neven though it had appeared in the beginning that the trust level was so low and the rupture in the \\nrelationship so large as to be almost irreparable. \\nAt one of our development programs, an execut ive reported a situation where a manufacturer was \\nbeing sued by a longtime industrial customer for lack of performance.  Both part ies felt totally justified \\nin the rightness of their position and perceived each  other as unethical and completely untrustworthy. \\nAs they began to practice Habit 5, two things became clear. First, early communication problems \\nresulted in a misunderstanding which was later ex acerbated by accusations and counteraccusations. \\nSecond, both were initially acting in good faith and didn\\'t like the cost and hassle of a legal fight, but \\nsaw no other way out. \\nOnce these two things became clear, the spirit  of Habits 4, 5, and 6 took over, the problem was \\nrapidly resolved, and the relationship continues to prosper. \\nIn another circumstance, I received an early morning phone call from a land developer desperately \\nsearching for help. The bank wanted to foreclos e because he was not comp lying with the principal '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 144}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nand interest payment schedule, and he was suing th e bank to avoid the fore closure.  He needed \\nadditional funding to finish and market the land so  that he could repay the bank, but the bank refused \\nto provide additional funds unt il scheduled payments were met. It was a chicken-and-egg problem \\nwith undercapitalization. \\nIn the meantime, the project was languishing. The streets were beginning to look like weed fields, \\nand the owners of the few homes that  had been built were up in arms as  they saw their property values \\ndrop. The city was also upset over the \"prime land\" project falling behind schedule and becoming an \\neyesore. Tens of thousands of dollars in legal costs had already been sp ent by the bank and the \\ndeveloper and the case wasn\\'t scheduled to come to court for several months. \\nIn desperation, this developer reluctantly agreed to try the principles of Habits 4, 5, and 6. He \\narranged a meeting with even more reluctant bank officials. \\nThe meeting started at 8 A.M. in one of the bank conference rooms. The tension and mistrust \\nwere palpable. The attorney for th e bank had committed the bank offici als to say nothing. They were \\nonly to listen and he alone would speak. He wanted nothing to happen that would compromise the bank\\'s position in court. \\nFor the first hour and a half, I taught Habits 4, 5, and 6. At 9:30 I went to the blackboard and wrote \\ndown the bank\\'s concerns based on our prior understa nding. Initially the bank officials said nothing, \\nbut the more we communicated win-win intentions an d sought first to understand, the more they \\nopened up to explain and clarify. \\nAs they began to feel understood, the whol e atmosphere changed and a sense of momentum, of \\nexcitement over the prospect of peacefully settl ing the problem was clearl y evident.  Over the \\nattorney\\'s objections the bank officials opened up even more, even about personal concerns. \"When we walk out of here the first thing the bank president will say is, \\'Did we get our money?\\' What are we going to say?\" \\nBy 11:00, the bank officers were still convinced of their rightness, but they felt understood and were \\nno longer defensive and officious. At that point, they wer e sufficiently open to listen to the developer\\'s \\nconcerns, which we wrote down on th e other side of the blackboard. This resulted in deeper mutual \\nunderstanding and a collective awareness of ho w poor early communication had resulted in \\nmisunderstanding and unrealistic expectations, and how continuous communicat ion in a win-win spirit \\ncould have prevented the subsequent major problems from developing. \\nThe shared sense of both chronic and acute pain  combined with a sense of genuine progress kept \\neveryone communicating. By noon, when the meetin g was scheduled to end, the people were positive, \\ncreative, and synergistic and wanted to keep talking. \\nThe very first recommendation made by the de veloper was seen as a beginning win-win approach \\nby all. It was synergized on and improved, and at  12:45 P.M. the developer and the two bank officers \\nleft with a plan to present together to the Home Owners\\' Association and the city. Despite subsequent \\ncomplicating developments, the legal fight was ab orted and the building project continued to  a \\nsuccessful conclusion. \\nI am not suggesting that people should not use le gal processes. Some situations absolutely require \\nit. But I see it as a court of last, not first, resort. If it is used too early, even in a preventive sense, \\nsometimes fear and the legal paradigm create subsequent thought and action processes that are not synergistic. \\nAll Nature is Synergistic \\nEcology is a word which basically describes the synergism in nature -- everything is related to \\neverything else. It\\'s in the relati onship that creative powers are maxi mized, just as the real power in \\nthese Seven Habits is in their relationship to each other, not just in the individual habits themselves. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 145}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nThe relationship of the parts is also the power in creating a synergistic culture inside a family or an \\norganization. The more genuine the involvement, th e more sincere and sustained the participation in \\nanalyzing and solving problems, the greater the re lease of everyone\\'s creativity, and of their \\ncommitment to what they create. This, I\\'m convince d, is the essence of the power in the Japanese \\napproach to business, which has changed the world marketplace. \\nSynergy works; it\\'s a correct principle. It is the crowning achievement of all the previous habits. \\nIt is effectiveness in an interdependent reality -- it is teamwork, team building, the development of \\nunity and creativity with other human beings. \\nAlthough you cannot control the paradigms of others in an interdepen dent interaction or the \\nsynergistic process itself, a great deal of sy nergy is within your Circle of Influence. \\nYour own internal synergy is completely within the circle. You can respect both sides of your own \\nnature -- the analytical side and the creative side. You can value the difference between them and use \\nthat difference to catalyze creativity. \\nYou can be synergistic within yourself even in  the midst of a very adversarial environment. You \\ndon\\'t have to take insults personally. You can side step negative energy; you can look for the good in \\nothers and utilize that good, as diffe rent as it may be, to improve you point of view and to enlarge your \\nperspective. \\nYou can exercise the courage in interdependent situations to be open, to express your ideas, your \\nfeelings, and your experiences in a way that will encourage other people to be open also. \\nYou can value the difference in other people. When someone disagrees with you, you can say, \\n\"Good! You see it differently.\" You don\\'t have to ag ree with them; you can simply affirm them. And \\nyou can seek to understand. \\nWhen you see only two alternatives -- yours an d the \"wrong\" one -- you can look for a synergistic \\nThird Alternative. There\\'s almost always a Thir d Alternative, and if you work with a win-win \\nphilosophy and really seek to un derstand, you usually can find a solution that will be better for \\neveryone concerned. \\nApplication Suggestions \\n1. Think about a person who typically sees th ings differently than you do. Consider ways in \\nwhich those differences might be used as stepping-stones to Third Alternative solutions. Perhaps you \\ncould seek out his or her views on a current projec t or problem, valuing the different views you are \\nlikely to hear. \\n2. Make a list of people who irritate you.  Do  they represent different views that could lead to \\nsynergy if you had greater intrinsic security and valued the differences. \\n3. Identify a situation in which you desire greater teamwork and synergy.  What conditions \\nwould need to exist to support synergy? What can you do to create those conditions. \\n4. The next time you have a disagreement or confrontation with someone, attempt to understand \\nthe concerns underlying that person\\'s position. Address those concerns in a creative and mutually \\nbeneficial way.

I am \\ntempted to think...there are no little things. \\n   -- Bruce Barton \\n*  * \\nSuppose you were to come upon someone in th e woods working feverishly to saw down a tree. \\n\"What are you doing?\" you ask. \\n\"Can\\'t you see?\" comes the impatient reply. \"I\\'m sawing down this tree.\" \\n\"You look exhausted!\" you exclaim. \"How long have you been at it?\" \\n\"Over five hours,\" he returns, \"and I\\'m beat! This is hard work.\" \\n\"Well, why don\\'t you take a break for a few minu tes and sharpen the saw?\" you inquire. \"I\\'m sure \\nit would go a lot faster.\" \\n\"I don\\'t have time to sharpen the saw,\" the man says emphatically. \"I\\'m too busy sawing!\" \\nHabit 7 is taking time to Sharpen the Saw. It surrounds the other habits on the Seven Habits \\nparadigm because it is the habit th at makes all the others possible. \\nFour Dimensions of Renewal \\nHabit 7 is personal PC. It\\'s preserving and e nhancing the greatest asset you have -- you. It\\'s \\nrenewing the four dimensions of your nature -- physical, spiritual, mental, and social/emotional. \\nAlthough different words are used, most philosophie s of life deal either explicitly or implicitly with \\nthese four dimensions. Philosopher Herb Shepherd  describes the healthy balanced life around four \\nvalues: perspective (spiritual), autonomy (mental), co nnectedness (social), and tone (physical). George \\nSheehan, the running guru, describes four roles: be ing a good animal (physi cal), a good craftsman \\n(mental), a good friend (social), and a saint (spiri tual). Sound motivation and organization theory \\nembrace these four dimensions or motivations -- the economic (physical); how people are treated \\n(social); how people are developed and used (mental) ; and the service, the job, the contribution the \\norganization gives (spiritual). \\n   \"Sharpen the Saw\" basically me ans expressing all four motivations.   It means exercising all four \\ndimensions of our nature, regularly and co nsistently, in wise and balanced ways. \\nTo do this, we must be proactive. Taking time to sharpen the saw is a definite Quadrant II activity, \\nand Quadrant II must be acted on. Quadrant I, because of its urgency, acts on us; it presses upon us \\nconstantly. Personal PC must be pressed upon until it becomes second nature, until it becomes a kind \\nof healthy addiction. Because it\\'s at the center of our Circle of Influence, no one else can do it for us. \\nWe must do it for ourselves. \\nThis is the single most powerful investment we can ever make in life -- investment in ourselves, in \\nthe only instrument we have with wh ich to deal with life and to contribute. We are the instruments of \\nour own performance, and to be effective, we need to  recognize the importance of taking time regularly \\nto sharpen the saw in all four ways. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 147}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nThe Physical Dimension \\nThe physical dimension involves caring effectivel y for our physical body -- eating the right kinds of \\nfoods, getting sufficient rest and relaxati on, and exercising on a regular basis. \\nExercise is one of those Quadrant II, high-leverag e activities that most of us don\\'t do consistently \\nbecause it isn\\'t urgent. And because we don\\'t do it, sooner or later we find ourselves in Quadrant I, \\ndealing with the health problems and crises th at come as a natural result of our neglect. \\nMost of us think we don\\'t have enough time to  exercise. What a distorted paradigm! We don\\'t have \\ntime not to. We\\'re talking about three to six hour s a week -- or a minimum of thirty minutes a day, \\nevery other day. That hardly seems an inordinate amount of time considering the tremendous benefits \\nin terms of the impact on the other 162-165 hours of the week. \\nAnd you don\\'t need any special equipment to do it . If you want to go to a gym or a spa to use the \\nequipment or enjoy some skill sports such as tennis or  racquetball, that\\'s an added opportunity. But it \\nisn\\'t necessary to sharpen the saw. \\nA good exercise program is one that you can do in your own home and one that will build your \\nbody in three areas: endurance, flexibility, and strength. \\nEndurance comes from aerobic exercise, from card iovascular efficiency -- the ability of your heart to \\npump blood through your body. \\nAlthough the heart is a muscle, it cannot be exer cised directly. It can only  be exercised through the \\nlarge muscle groups, particularly the leg muscles. That\\'s why exercises like rapid walking, running, \\nbiking, swimming, cross-country skiing, and jogging are so beneficial. \\nYou are considered minimally fit if you can incr ease your heart rate to at least 100 beats per minute \\nand keep it at that level for 30 minutes. \\nIdeally you should try to raise your heart rate to  at least 60 percent of your maximum pulse rate, the \\ntop speed your heart can beat and still pump blood through your body. Your maximum heart rate is generally accepted to be 220 less your age. So, if  you are 40, you should aim for an exercise heart rate \\nof 108 (220 - 40 = 180 x .6 = 108). The \"training effect\" is generally considered to be between 72 and 87 \\npercent of your personal maximum rate. \\n   Flexibility comes through stretching.  Most experts recommend warming up before and cooling \\ndown/stretching after aerobic exercise. Before, it helps loosen and warm the muscles to prepare for \\nmore vigorous exercise. After, it helps to dissipate th e lactic acid so that you don\\'t feel sore and stiff. \\nStrength comes from muscle resistance exercises -- like simple calisthenics,  push-ups, and sit-ups, \\nand from working with weights. How much emphas is you put on developing strength depends on \\nyour situation. If you\\'re involved in physical la bor or athletic activities, increased strength will \\nimprove your skill. If you have a basically sedentary  job and success in your life-style does not require \\na lot of strength, a little toning through calisthenics in  addition to your aerobic and stretching exercises \\nmight be sufficient. \\nI was in a gym one time with a friend of mine who has a Ph. D. in exercise physiology. He was \\nfocusing on building strength. He asked me to \"s pot\" him while he did some bench presses and told \\nme at a certain point he\\'d ask me to take the weight. \"But don\\'t take it until I tell you,\" he said firmly. \\nSo I watched and waited and prepared to take the weight.  The weight went up and down, up and \\ndown. And I could see it begin to get harder. But he  kept going. He would start to push it up and \\nI\\'d think, \"There\\'s no way he\\'s going to make it.\" But he\\'d make it. Then he\\'d slowly bring it back \\ndown and start back up again. Up and down, up and down. \\nFinally, as I looked at his face, straining with the effort, his blood vessels practically jumping out of \\nhis skin, I thought, \"This is going to fall and colla pse his chest. Maybe I should take the weight. \\nMaybe he\\'s lost control and he does n\\'t even know what he\\'s doing.\" Bu t he\\'d get it safely down. Then '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 148}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nhe\\'d start back up again. I couldn\\'t believe it\" \\n\"Almost all the benefit of the exercise comes at th e very end, Stephen,\" he replied. \"I\\'m trying to \\nbuild strength. And that doesn\\'t happen until the muscle fiber ruptures and the nerve fiber registers \\nthe pain. Then nature overcompensates and with in 48 hours, the fiber is made stronger.\" \\nI could see his point. It\\'s the same principle that works with emotional muscles as well, such as \\npatience. When you exercise your patience beyond  your past limits, the emotional fiber is broken, \\nnature overcompensates, and next time the fiber is stronger. \\nNow my friend wanted to build muscular strength . And he knew how to do it. But not all of us \\nneed to develop that kind of strength to be effective.  \"No pain, no gain\" has validity in some \\ncircumstances, but it is not the essence of an effective exercise program. \\nThe essence of renewing the physical dimension is  to sharpen the saw, to exercise our bodies on a \\nregular basis in a way that will preserve and e nhance our capacity to work and adapt and enjoy. \\nAnd we need to be wise in developing an exer cise program.  There\\'s a te ndency, especially if you \\nhaven\\'t been exercising at all, to overdo. And that can create unnecessary  pain, injury, and even \\npermanent damage. It\\'s best to start slowly. An y exercise program should be in harmony with the \\nlatest research findings, with your doctor\\'s re commendations and with your own self-awareness. \\nIf you haven\\'t been exercising, your body will undoubtedly protest this change in its comfortable \\ndownhill direction.  You won\\'t like it at first.  Y o u  m a y  e v e n  h a t e  i t .   B u t  b e  p r o a c t i v e .   D o  i t \\nanyway. Even if it\\'s raining on the morning you\\'ve scheduled to jog, do it anyway. \"Oh good! It\\'s \\nraining! I get to develop my willpower as well as my body!\" \\nYou\\'re not dealing with quick fix; you\\'re de aling with a Quadrant II activity that will bring \\nphenomenal long-term results. Ask anyone who has done it consistently. Little by little, your resting pulse rate will go down as your heart and oxygen proc essing system becomes more efficient. As you \\nincrease your body\\'s ability to do more demanding th ings, you\\'ll find your normal activities much more \\ncomfortable and pleasant. You\\'ll have more afternoon  energy, and the fatigue you\\'ve felt that\\'s made \\nyou \"too tired\" to exercise in the past will be replac ed by an energy that will invigorate everything you \\ndo. \\nProbably the greatest benefit you will experience  from exercising will be the development of your \\nHabit 1 muscles of proactivity.  As you act base d on the value of physical well-being instead of \\nreacting to all the forces that keep you from exercising, your paradigm of yourself, your self-esteem, \\nyour self-confidence, and your integrity will be profoundly affected. \\nThe Spiritual Dimension \\nRenewing the spiritual dimension provides leadersh ip to your life. It\\'s highly related to Habit 2. \\nThe spiritual dimension is your core, your cent er, your commitment to your value system. It\\'s a \\nvery private area of life and a supremely important one. It draws upon the sources that inspire and \\nuplift you and tie you to the timeless truths of all hu manity. And people do it very, very differently. \\nI find renewal in daily prayerful meditation on the scriptures because they represent my value \\nsystem. As I read and meditate, I feel renewed, strengthened, centered, and recommitted to serve. \\nImmersion in great literature or great music can provide a similar renewal of the spirit for some. \\nThere are others who find it in the way they communicate with na ture. Nature bequeaths its own \\nblessing on those who immerse themselves in it. When you\\'re able to leave the noise and the discord \\nof the city and give yourself up to the harmony an d rhythm of nature, you co me back renewed.  For a \\ntime, you\\'re undisturbable, almost unflappable, unt il gradually the noise and the discord from outside \\nstart to invade that sense of inner peace. \\nArthur Gordon shares a wonderful, intimate story of his own spiritual renewal in a little story called \\n\"The Turn of the Tide.\" It tells of a time in his lif e when he began to feel that everything was stale and '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 149}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nflat. His enthusiasm waned; his writing efforts wer e fruitless. And the situation was growing worse \\nday by day. \\n   Finally, he determined to get help from a medical doctor. Observing nothing physically wrong, the \\ndoctor asked him if he would be able to follow his instructions for one day. \\nWhen Gordon replied that he could, the doctor  told him to spend the following day in the place \\nwhere he was happiest as a child. He could take food , but he was not to talk to anyone or to read or \\nwrite or listen to the radio. He then wrote out four  prescriptions and told him to open one at nine, \\ntwelve, three, and six o\\'clock. \\n\"Are you serious?\" Gordon asked him. \\n\"You won\\'t think I\\'m joking when you get my bill!\" was the reply. \\nSo the next morning, Gordon went to the beach. As he opened the firs t prescription, he read \\n\"Listen carefully.\" He thought the doctor was insane. How could he listen for three hours? But he had \\nagreed to follow the doctor\\'s orders, so he listened. He heard the usual sounds of the sea and the birds. \\nAfter a while, he could hear the other sounds that weren\\'t  so apparent at first. As he listened, he began \\nto think of lessons the sea had taught him as a child -- patience, respec t, an awareness of the \\ninterdependence of things. He bega n to listen to the sounds -- and th e silence -- and to feel a growing \\npeace. \\nAt noon, he opened the second slip of paper and read \"Try reaching back.\" \"Reaching back to what?\" \\nhe wondered. Perhaps to childhood, perhaps to memo ries of happy times. He thought about his past, \\nabout the many little moments of joy. He tried to remember them with exactness.  And in \\nremembering, he found a growing warmth inside. \\nAt three o\\'clock, he opened the third piece of paper.  Until now, the prescr iptions had been easy to \\ntake. But this one was different; it said \"Examine  your motives.\" At first he was defensive.  He \\nthought about what he wanted -- success, recognition,  security, and he justified them all. But then the \\nthought occurred to him that thos e motives weren\\'t good enough, an d that perhaps therein was the \\nanswer to his stagnant situation. \\nHe considered his motives deeply. He thought about past happiness. And at last, the answer \\ncame to him. \\n\"In a flash of certainty,\" he wr ote, \"I saw that if one\\'s motives are  wrong, nothing can be right. It \\nmakes no difference whether you are a mailman, a ha irdresser, an insurance salesman, a housewife -- \\nwhatever. As long as you feel you are serving ot hers, you do the job well. When you are concerned \\nonly with helping yourself, you do it less well -- a law as inexorable as gravity.\" \\nWhen six o\\'clock came, the final prescription didn\\'t take long to fill. \"Write your worries on the \\nsand,\" it said. He knelt and wrote several words wi th a piece of broken she ll; then he turned and \\nwalked away. He didn\\'t look back ; he knew the tide would come in. \\nSpiritual renewal takes an investment of time. But it\\'s a Quadrant II acti vity we don\\'t really have \\ntime to neglect. \\nThe great reformer Martin Luther is quoted as sayi ng, \"I have so much to do  today, I\\'ll need to spend \\nanother hour on my knees.\" To him, prayer was not a mechanical duty but rather a source of power in \\nreleasing and multiplying his energies. \\nSomeone once inquired of a Far Eastern Zen master, who had a great serenity and peace about him \\nno matter what pressures he faced, \"How do you main tain that serenity and peac e?\" He replied, \"I never \\nleave my place of meditation.\" He meditated early in the morning and for the rest of the day, he carried \\nthe peace of those moments with  him in his mind and heart. \\nThe idea is that when we take time to draw on  the leadership center of our lives, what life is \\nultimately all about, it spreads like an umbrella ov er everything else. It renews us, it refreshes us, \\nparticularly if we recommit to it. \\nThis is why I believe a personal mission st atement is so important.  If we have a deep '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 150}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nunderstanding of our center and our purpose, we ca n review and recommit to it frequently. In our \\ndaily spiritual renewal, we can visualize and \"live ou t\" the events of the day in harmony with those \\nvalues. \\nReligious leader David O. McKay taught, \"The gr eatest battles of life are fought out daily in the \\nsilent chambers of the soul.\" If you win the battles th ere, if you settle the issues that inwardly conflict, \\nyou feel a sense of peace, a sense of knowing what  you\\'re about. And you\\'ll find that the Public \\nVictories -- where you tend to think cooperatively, to promote the welfare and good of other people, \\nand to be genuinely happy for other pe ople\\'s successes -- will follow naturally. \\nThe Mental Dimension \\nMost of our mental development and study di scipline comes through form al education.  But as \\nsoon as we leave the external discipline of school, many  of us let our minds atrophy. We don\\'t do any \\nmore serious reading, we don\\'t explore new subjects  in any real depth outside our action fields, we \\ndon\\'t think analytically, we don\\'t write -- at least not critically or in a way that tests our ability to \\nexpress ourselves in distilled, clear, and concise language. Instead, we spend our time watching TV. \\nContinuing surveys indicate that television is on  in most homes some 35 to 45 hours a week. That\\'s \\nas much time as many people put into their jobs, more than most put into school. It\\'s the most \\npowerful socializing influence there is. And when we watch, we\\'re su bject to all the values that are \\nbeing taught through it. That can powerfully infl uence us in very subtle and imperceptible ways. \\nWisdom in watching television requires the effective self-management of Habit 3, which enables you \\nto discriminate and to select the in forming, inspiring, and entertaining programs which best serve and \\nexpress your purpose and values. \\nIn our family, we limit television watching to around seven hours a week, an average of about an \\nhour a day. We had a family coun cil at which we talked about it and looked at some of the data \\nregarding what\\'s happening in homes because of television. We found th at by discussing it as a family \\nwhen no one was defensive or argumentative, people  started to realize the dependent sickness of \\nbecoming addicted to soap operas or to  a steady diet of a particular program. \\n   I\\'m grateful for television and for the many high-quality educat ional and entertainment programs. \\nThey can enrich our lives and contri bute meaningfully to our purposes  and goals. But there are many \\nprograms that simply waste our time and minds and many  that influence us in ne gative ways if we let \\nthem. Like the body, television is a good servant bu t a poor master. We need to practice Habit 3 and \\nmanage ourselves effectively to maximize the use of any resource in accomplishing our missions. \\nEducation -- continuing education, continually honing and expanding the mind -- is vital mental \\nrenewal. Sometimes that involves the external discipline of the classroom or systematized study \\nprograms; more often it does not. Proactive pe ople can figure out many, many ways to educate \\nthemselves. \\nIt is extremely valuable to train the mind to stand apart and examine its ow n program. That, to me, \\nis the definition of a liberal education -- the ab ility to examine the programs of life against larger \\nquestions and purposes and other paradigms. Training, without such education, narrows and closes the mind so that the assumptions underlying the tr aining are never examined. That\\'s why it is so \\nvaluable to read broadly and to expose yourself to great minds. \\nThere\\'s no better way to inform and expand your mind on a regular basis than to get into the habit \\nof reading good literature. That\\'s another high-l everage Quadrant II activity. You can get into the \\nbest minds that are now or that have ever been in the world. I highly recommend starting with a goal \\nof a book a month then a book every two weeks, then a book a week. \"The person who doesn\\'t read is no better off than the person who can\\'t read.\" '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 151}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nQuality literature, such as the Great Books,  the Harvard Classics, autobiographies, National \\nGeographic and other publications that expand our cultural awareness, and current literature in various \\nfields can expand our paradigms and sharpen our ment al saw, particularly if we practice Habit 5 as we \\nread and seek first to understand. If we use our own autobiography to make early judgments before \\nwe really understand what an author has to say,  we limit the benefits of the reading experience. \\nWriting is another powerful way to sharpen the mental saw. Keeping a journal of our thoughts, \\nexperiences, insights, and learnings promotes mental  clarity, exactness, and context. Writing good \\nletters -- communicating on the deeper level of thoughts, feelings, and ideas rather than on the shallow, \\nsuperficial level of events -- also affects our ability to think clearly, to reason accurately, and to be understood effectively. \\nOrganizing and planning represent other forms of  mental renewal associated with Habits 2 and 3. \\nIt\\'s beginning with the end in mind and being able mentally to organize to accomplish that end. It\\'s \\nexercising the visualizing, imagining power of your mind to see the end from the beginning and to see \\nthe entire journey, at least in principles, if not in steps. \\nIt is said that wars are won in the general\\'s te nt.  Sharpening the saw in th e first three dimensions -- \\nthe physical, the spiritual, and the mental -- is a practice I call the \"Daily Private Victory.\" And I \\ncommend to you the simple practice of spending on e hour a day every day doing it -- one hour a day \\nfor the rest of your life. \\nThere\\'s no other way you coul d spend an hour that would begin to compare with the Daily Private \\nVictory in terms of value and results. It will affect  every decision, every relationship. It will greatly \\nimprove the quality, the effectiveness, of every other hour of the day, including the depth and \\nrestfulness of your sleep. It will build the long-term physical, spiritua l, and mental strength to enable \\nyou to handle difficult challenges in life. \\nIn the words of Phillips Brooks: \\nSome day, in the years to come, you will be wr estling with the great temptation, or trembling under \\nthe great sorrow of your life. But the real struggle is here, now. Now it is being decided whether, in \\nthe day of your supreme sorrow or temptation, you shall miserably fail or gloriously conquer. \\nCharacter cannot be made except by a steady, long continued process. \\nThe Social/Emotional Dimension \\nWhile the physical, spiritual, and mental dimensions are closely related to Habits 1, 2, and 3 --\\ncentered on the principles of personal vision, leadership, and management  -- the social/emotional \\ndimension focuses on Habits 4, 5, and 6 -- centered on the principles of interpersonal leadership, \\nempathic communication, and creative cooperation. \\nThe social and the emotional dimensions of our liv es are tied together because our emotional life is \\nprimarily, but not exclusively, developed out of an d manifested in our relationships with others. \\nRenewing our social/emotional dimension does not take time in the same sense that renewing the \\nother dimensions does. We can do it in our normal  everyday interactions with other people. But it \\ndefinitely requires exercise. We may have to push ourselves because many of us have not achieved the \\nlevel of Private Victory and the skills of Public Victor y necessary for Habits 4, 5, and 6 to come naturally \\nto us in all our interactions. \\nSuppose that you are a key person in my lif e.  You might be my bo ss, my subordinate, my \\nco-worker, my friend, my neighbor, my spouse, my child, a member of my extended family -- anyone \\nwith whom I want or need to interact. Suppose we need to communicate together, to work together, \\nto discuss a jugular issue, to accomplish a purpose or  solve a problem. But we see things differently; \\nwe\\'re looking through different glasses. You see the young lady, and I see the old woman.

I come to you and I say, \"I can see that we\\'re approaching this situation \\ndifferently. Why don\\'t we agree to communicate until we can find a solution we both feel good about. \\nWould you be willing to do that?\" Most peop le would be willing to say \"yes\" to that. \\nThen I move to Habit 5. \"Let me listen to you firs t.\" Instead of listening with intent to reply, I listen \\nempathically in order to deeply, thoroughly understand your parad igm. When I can explain your \\npoint of view as well as you can, then I focus on communicating my point of view to you so that you \\ncan understand it as well. \\nBased on the commitment to search for a solu tion that we both feel good about and a deep \\nunderstanding of each other\\'s points of view, we move to Habit 6. We work together to produce Third \\nAlternative solutions to our differences that we both recognize are better than th e ones either you or I \\nproposed initially. \\nSuccess in Habits 4, 5, and 6 is not primarily a matte r of intellect; it\\'s primarily a matter of emotion. \\nIt\\'s highly related to our sense of personal security. \\nIf our personal security comes from sources within  ourselves, then we have the strength to practice \\nthe habits of Public Victory. If we are emotionall y insecure, even though we may be intellectually very \\nadvanced, practicing Habits 4, 5, and 6 with people wh o think differently on jugular issues of life can be \\nterribly threatening. \\nWhere does intrinsic security come from? It do esn\\'t come from the scripts they\\'ve handed us. It \\ndoesn\\'t come from our circumstances or our position. \\n   It comes from within.  It comes from accurate paradigms and correct principles deep in our own \\nmind and heart. It comes from Insi de-Out congruence, from living a life  of integrity in which our daily \\nhabits reflect our deepest values. \\nI believe that a life of integrity is the most fundamental source of personal worth. I do not agree \\nwith the popular success literature that  says that self-esteem is primarily  a matter of mindset, of attitude \\n-- that you can psyche yourself into peace of mind. \\nPeace of mind comes when your life is in harmon y with true principles an d values and in no other \\nway. \\nThere is also the intrinsic security that comes as a result of effective interd ependent living.  There is \\nsecurity in knowing that win-win solutions do exist, that life is not always \"either/or,\" that there are \\nalmost always mutually beneficial Third Alternatives . There is security in knowing that you can step \\nout of your own frame of reference without giving it  up, that you can really, deeply understand another \\nhuman being. There is security  that comes when you authentica lly, creatively, and cooperatively \\ninteract with other people and really e xperience these interdependent habits. \\nThere is intrinsic security that comes from servic e, from helping other people in a meaningful way. \\nOne important source is your work, when you see yourself in a contri butive and creative mode, really \\nmaking a difference. Another source is anonymous service -- no one knows it and no one necessarily \\never will. And that\\'s not the concern; the concern is  blessing the lives of other people. Influence, not \\nrecognition, becomes the motive. \\n   Viktor Frankl focused on the need for meaning and purpose in ou r lives, something that transcends \\nour own lives and taps the best energies within us. The late Dr. Hans Selye, in his monumental \\nresearch on stress, basically says that a long, healthy, and happy life is the result of making \\ncontributions, of having meaningful projects that are  personally exciting and contribute to and bless the \\nlives of others. His ethic was \"earn thy neighbor\\'s love. \\nThis is the true joy in life -- that being used for a purpose recogniz ed by yourself as a mighty one. \\nThat being a force of nature, instead of a feverish , selfish little clod of ailments and grievances \\ncomplaining that the world will not devote itself to  making you happy. I am of the opinion that my \\nlife belongs to the whole community and as long as I live it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. \\nI want to be thoroughly used up when I die. For th e harder I work the more I live. I rejoice in life for '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 153}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nits own sake. Life is no brief candle to me. It\\'s a sort of splendid torch which I\\'ve got to hold up for \\nt h e  m o m e n t  a n d  I  w a n t  t o  m a k e  i t  b u r n  a s  b r i g h t ly as possible before handing it on to future \\ngenerations. \\nN. Eldon Tanner has said, \"Service is the rent we pay for the privilege of living on this earth.\" And \\nthere are so many ways to serve. Whether or no t we belong to a church or service organization or \\nhave a job that provides meaningful service opportunit ies, not a day goes by that we can\\'t at least serve \\none other human being by making deposits of unconditional love. \\nScripting Others \\n   Most people are a function of  the social mirror, scripted by th e opinions, the perceptions, the \\nparadigms of the people around th em.  As interdependent people, you and I come from a paradigm \\nwhich includes the realization that we are a part of that social mirror. \\nWe can choose to reflect back to others a clear, undistorted vision of themselves. We can affirm \\ntheir proactive nature and treat them as responsible people.  We can help script them as \\nprinciple-centered, value-based, independent, worthwhile individuals.  And, with the Abundance \\nMentality, we realize that giving a positive reflection to others in no way diminishes us. It increases us \\nbecause it increases the opportunities for effe ctive interaction with other proactive people. \\nAt some time in your life, you probably had someone believe in you when  you didn\\'t believe in \\nyourself. He or she scripted you. Did that make a difference in your life. \\nWhat if you were a positive scripter, an affirme r, of other people? When they\\'re being directed by \\nthe social mirror to take the lower path, you inspire them toward a hi gher path because you believe in \\nthem. You listen to them and empathize with them . You don\\'t absolve them of responsibility; you \\nencourage them to be proactive. \\n   Perhaps you are familiar with the musical, Man of La Mancha. It\\'s a beautiful story about a \\nmedieval knight who meets a woman of the street, a pr ostitute. She\\'s being validated in her life-style \\nby all of the people in her life. \\nBut this poet knight sees something else in he r, something beautiful and lovely. He also sees her \\nvirtue, and he affirms it, over and over again. He gives her a new name -- Dulcinea -- a new name \\nassociated with a new paradigm. \\nAt first, she utterly denies it; her old scripts are overpowering. She writes him off as a wild-eyed \\nfantasizer. But he is persistent.  He makes contin ual deposits of unconditional love and gradually it \\npenetrates her scripting. It goes down into her true nature, her potential, an d she starts to respond. \\nLittle by little, she begins to change her life-style. She believes it and she acts from her new paradigm, \\nto the initial dismay of everyone else in her life. \\nLater, when she begins to revert to her old paradigm, he calls her to his deathbed and sings that \\nbeautiful song, \"The Impossible Dream,\" looks her in the eyes, and whispers, \"Never forget, you\\'re \\nDulcinea.\" \\nOne of the classic stories in th e field of self-fulfilling prophecies is of a computer in England that was \\naccidentally programmed incorrectly. In academic term s, it labeled a class of \"bright\" kids \"dumb\" and \\na class of supposedly \"dumb\" kids \"bright.\" And that  computer report was the primary criterion that \\ncreated the teachers\\' paradigms about their students at the beginning of the year. \\nWhen the administration finally discovered the mistake five-and-a-half months later, they decided \\nto test the kids again without telling anyone what  had happened. And the results were amazing. The \\n\"bright\" kids had gone down significantly in IQ test points.  They had been seen and treated as \\nmentally limited, uncooperative, and difficult to teach.  The teachers\\' paradigms had become a self-fulfilling prophecy. '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 154}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nBut the scores in the supposedly \"dumb\" group had gone up. The teachers had treated them as \\nthough they were bright, and their energy, their ho pe, their optimism, their excitement had reflected \\nhigh individual expectations and worth for those kids. \\nThese teachers were asked what it was like du ring the first few weeks of the term. \"For some \\nreason, our methods weren\\'t working,\" they replied.  \"So we had to change our methods.\" The \\ninformation showed that the kids wer e bright. If things weren\\'t workin g well, they figured it had to be \\nthe teaching methods. So they worked on methods. They were proactive; they worked in their Circle \\nof Influence.  Apparent learner disability was nothing more or less than teacher inflexibility. \\nWhat do we reflect to others about themselves? And how much does that reflection influence their \\nlives? We have so much we can invest in the Emotio nal Bank Accounts of other people. The more we \\ncan see people in terms of their unseen potential,  the more we can use our im agination rather than our \\nmemory, with our spouse, our children, our co-workers  or employees. We can refuse to label them --\\nwe can \"see\" them in new fresh ways each time we\\'re with them.  We can help them become \\nindependent, fulfilled people capable of deeply satisf ying, enriching, and productive relationships with \\nothers. \\nGoethe taught, \"Treat a man as he is and he will remain as he is. Treat a man as he can and should \\nbe and he will become as he can and should be.\" \\nBalance in Renewal \\nThe self-renewal process must include balanced renewal in all four dimens ions of our nature: the \\nphysical, the spiritual, the mental, and the social/emotional. \\nAlthough renewal in each dimension is importan t, it only becomes optima lly effective as we deal \\nwith all four dimensions in a wise and balanced wa y. To neglect any one area negatively impacts the \\nrest. \\nI have found this to be true in organizations as  well as in individual lives .  In an organization, the \\nphysical dimension is expressed in economic term s. The mental or psychological dimension deals \\nwith the recognition, development, and use of talent. The social/emotional dimension has to do with \\nhuman relations, with finding meaning through purp ose or contribution and through organizational \\nintegrity. \\nWhen an organization neglects any one or more  of these areas, it negatively impacts the entire \\norganization. The creative energies that could result in tremendous, positive synergy are instead used \\nto fight against the organization and become re straining forces to growth and productivity. \\nI have found organizations whose only thrust is  economic -- to make mo ney.  They usually don\\'t \\npublicize that purpose. They sometimes even public ize something else. But in their hearts, their only \\ndesire is to make money. \\nWhenever I find this, I also find a great deal of negative synergy in the culture, generating such \\nthings as interdepartmental rivalries, defensiv e and protective communication, politicking, and \\nmasterminding. We can\\'t effectively thrive without making money, but that\\'s not sufficient reason for \\norganizational existence. We can\\'t live without eating, but we don\\'t live to eat. \\nAt the other end of the spectrum, I\\'ve seen or ganizations that focused almost exclusively on the \\nsocial/emotional dimension. They are, in a sense, some kind of social experiment and they have no economic criteria to their value system. They have no measure or gauge of their effectiveness, and as a \\nresult, they lose all kinds of efficiencies an d eventually their viability in the marketplace. \\nI have found many organizations that develop as  many as three of the dimensions -- they may have \\ngood service criteria, good economic criteria, and g ood human-relations criteria, but they are not really \\ncommitted to identifying, developing, utilizing, and recognizing the talent of people. And if these \\npsychological forces are missing, the style will be a benevolent autocracy and the resulting culture will '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 155}, page_content=\"T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nreflect different forms of collective resistance, ad versarialism, excessive turnover, and other deep, \\nchronic, cultural problems. \\nOrganizational as well as individual effectiv eness requires development and renewal of all four \\ndimensions in a wise and balanced way. Any dime nsion that is neglected w ill create negative force \\nfield resistance that pushes against effectiveness an d growth. Organizations and individuals that give \\nrecognition to each of these four dimensions in their mission statement provide a powerful framework \\nfor balanced renewal. \\nThis process of continuous improvement is the hallmark of the Total Quality movement and a key to \\nJapan's economic ascendancy. \\nSynergy in Renewal \\nBalanced renewal is optimally synergetic. The things you do to sharpen the saw in any one \\ndimension have positive impact in  other dimensions because they are so highly interrelated. Your \\nphysical health affects your mental health; your spiritual strength affects your social/emotional \\nstrength. As you improve in one dimension, you in crease your ability in other dimensions as well. \\nThe Seven Habits of Highly Effective People create optimum synergy among these dimensions. \\nRenewal in any dimension increases your ability to live at least one of the Seven Habits. And although \\nthe habits are sequential, improvement in one habit sy nergetically increases your ability to live the rest. \\nThe more proactive you are (Habit 1), the more  effectively you can exercise personal leadership \\n(Habit 2) and management (Habit 3) in your life. The more effectively you ma nage your life (Habit 3), \\nthe more Quadrant II renewing activities you can do (Habit 7). The more you seek first to understand \\n(Habit 5), the more effectively you can go for synerg etic win-win solutions (Hab its 4 and 6). The more \\nyou improve in any of the habits that lead to inde pendence (Habits 1, 2, and 3), the more effective you \\nwill be in interdependent situatio ns (Habits 4, 5, and 6). And renewal (Habit 7) is the process of \\nrenewing all the habits. \\nAs you renew your physical dimension, you rein force your personal vision (Habit 1), the paradigm \\nof your own self-awareness and free will, of proactivity, of knowing that you are free to act instead of \\nbeing acted upon, to choose your own response to any stimulus. This is probably the greatest benefit \\nof physical exercise. Each Daily Private Victory makes a deposit in your personal intrinsic security \\naccount. \\nAs you renew your spiritual dimension, you re inforce your personal leadership (Habit 2). You \\nincrease your ability to live out of your imaginatio n and conscience instead of only your memory, to \\ndeeply understand your innermost paradigms and values, to create within yourself a center of correct principles, to define your own uniq ue mission in life, to rescript your self to live your life in harmony \\nwith correct principles and to draw upon your pers onal sources of strength. The rich private life you \\ncreate in spiritual renewal makes tremendous deposits in your personal security account. \\nAs you renew your mental dimension, you reinfo rce your personal management (Habit 3). As you \\nplan, you force your mind to re cognize high-leverage Quadrant II activities, priority goals, and \\nactivities to maximize the use of your time and en ergy, and you organize and execute your activities \\naround your priorities. As you become involved  in continuing education, you increase your \\nknowledge base and you increase your options. Your economic security does not lie in your job; it lies \\nin your own power to produce -- to think, to learn, to create, to adapt.  That's true financial independence. It's not having wealth; it's having the power to produce we alth.  It's intrinsic. \\nThe Daily Private Victory -- a minimum of one hour  a day in renewal of the physical, spiritual, and \\nmental dimensions -- is the key to the development of  the Seven Habits and it's completely within your \\nCircle of Influence. It is the Qu adrant II focus time necessary to integ rate these habits into your life, to \\nbecome principle-centered. \"), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 156}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nIt\\'s also the foundation for the Daily Public Victor y. It\\'s the source of intrinsic security you need to \\nsharpen the saw in the social/emoti onal dimension.  It gives you th e personal strength to focus on \\nyour Circle of Influence in inte rdependent situations -- to look at others through the Abundance \\nMentality paradigm, to genuinely va lue their differences and to be happy for their success. It gives \\nyou the foundation to work for genuine understanding and for synergetic win-win solutions, to practice \\nHabits 4, 5, and 6 in an interdependent reality. \\nThe Upward Spiral \\nRenewal is the principle -- an d the process -- that empowers us to  move on an upward spiral of \\ngrowth and change, of continuous improvement. \\nTo make meaningful and consistent progress along that spiral, we need to consider one other aspect \\nof renewal as it applies to the unique human en dowment that directs this upward movement -- our \\nconscience. In the words of Madame de Sta\\'l, \"The voice of conscience is so delicate that it is easy to \\nstifle it: but it is also so clear that it is impossible to mistake it.\" \\nConscience is the endowment that senses our congruence or disparity with correct principles and \\nlifts us toward them -- when it\\'s in shape \\nJust as the education of nerve and sinew is vital to the excellent athlete and education of the mind is \\nvital to the scholar, education of the conscience is vita l to the truly proactive, highly effective person. \\nTraining and educating the conscience, however, requires even greater concentration, more balanced discipline, more consistently honest living. It requir es regular feasting on inspiring literature, thinking \\nnoble thoughts and, above all, living in harmony with its still small voice \\nJust as junk food and lack of exercise can ruin an athlete\\'s condition, thos e things that are obscene, \\ncrude, or pornographic can breed an inner darkness that numbs our higher sensibilities and substitutes \\nthe social conscience of \"Will I be found out?\" for the natural or divine conscience of \"What is right and \\nwrong?\" \\nIn the words of Dag Hammarskjold, \\nYou cannot play with the animal in you with out becoming wholly animal, play with falsehood \\nwithout forfeiting your right to truth, play with cr uelty without losing your sensitivity of mind. He \\nwho wants to keep his garden tidy doesn\\'t reserve a plot for weeds. \\nOnce we are self-aware, we must choose purposes and principles to live by; otherwise the vacuum \\nwill be filled, and we will lose our self-awareness and become like groveling animals who live primarily for survival and propagation. People who exist on th at level aren\\'t living; they are \"being lived.\" They \\nare reacting, unaware of the unique endowmen ts that lie dormant and undeveloped within. \\nAnd there is no shortcut in developing them. The Law of the Harvest governs; we will always reap \\nwhat we sow -- no more, no less. The law of justic e is immutable, and the closer we align ourselves \\nwith correct principles, the better our judgment w ill be about how the world operates and the more \\naccurate our paradigms -- our maps  of the territory -- will be. \\nI believe that as we grow and develop on this upward spiral, we must show diligence in the process \\nof renewal by educating and obeying our conscience. An increasingly educated conscience will propel \\nus along the path of personal freedom, security, wisdom, and power. \\nMoving along the upward spiral requires us to learn, commit, and do on incr easingly higher planes. \\nWe deceive ourselves if we think that any one of these is sufficient. To keep progressing, we must \\nlearn, commit, and do -- learn, commit, and do -- and learn, commit, and do again. \\nApplication Suggestions: '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 157}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\n1.

The worl d works from the outside in. The world would take \\npeople out of the slums. Christ takes the slums out of people, and then they ta ke themselves out of the \\nslums. The world would mold men by changing th eir environment. Christ changes men, who then \\nchange their environment. The world would shap e human behavior, but Christ can change human \\nnature. \\n   -- Ezra Taft Benson \\n*  * \\nI would like to share with you a personal story which I feel contai ns the essence of this book. In \\ndoing so, it is my hope that you will relate to the underlying principles it contains. \\nSome years ago, our family took a sabbatical le ave from the university where I taught so that I could \\nwrite. We lived for a full year in Laie on the north shore of Oahu, Hawaii. \\nShortly after getting settled, we developed a living and working routine which was not only very \\nproductive but extremely pleasant. \\nAfter an early morning run on the beach, we would send two of our children, barefoot and in shorts, \\nto school. I went to an isolated building next to the ca ne fields where I had an office to do my writing. \\nIt was very quiet, very beautiful, very serene -- no phone, no meetings, no pressing engagements. \\nMy office was on the outside edge of the colle ge, and one day as I was wandering between stacks of \\nbooks in the back of the college library, I came across a book that drew my interest. As I opened it, my \\neyes fell upon a single paragraph that power fully influenced the rest of my life. \\nI read the paragraph over and over again. It ba sically contained the simple idea that there is a gap \\nor a space between stimulus and re sponse, and that the key to both  our growth and happiness is how \\nwe use that space. \\nI can hardly describe the effect that idea had on my mind. Though I had been nurtured in the \\nphilosophy of self-determinism, the way the idea was phrased -- \"a ga p between stimulus and response\" \\n-- hit me with fresh, almost unbelievable force. It was almost like \"knowing it for the first time,\" like an \\ninward revolution, \"an idea whose time had come.\" \\nI reflected on it again and again, and it began to  have a powerful effect on my paradigm of life. It \\nwas as if I had become an observer of my own partic ipation. I began to stand in that gap and to look \\noutside at the stimuli. I reveled in the inward sense of freedom to choose my response -- even to \\nbecome the stimulus, or at least to influence it -- even to reverse it. \\n   Shortly thereafter, and partly as  a result of this \"revolutionary\" id ea, Sandra and I began a practice of '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 158}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\ndeep communication. I would pick her up a little be fore noon on an old red Honda 90 trail cycle, and \\nwe would take our two preschool children with us -- on e between us and the othe r on my left knee -- as \\nwe rode out in the canefields by my office. We ro de slowly along for about an hour, just talking. \\nThe children looked forward to the ride and hard ly ever made any noise. We seldom saw another \\nvehicle, and the cycle was so quiet we could easily  hear each other. We usually ended up on an \\nisolated beach where we parked the Honda and walked about 200 yard s to a secluded spot where we \\nate a picnic lunch. \\nThe sandy beach and a freshwater river coming off the island totally absorbed the interest of the \\nchildren, so Sandra and I were able to continue our talks uninterrupted. Perhaps it doesn\\'t take too \\nmuch imagination to envision the level of understa nding and trust we were able to reach by spending \\nat least two hours a day, every day, for a full year in deep communication. \\nAt the very first of the year, we talked about all kinds of interesting topics -- people, ideas, events, \\nthe children, my writing, our family at home, future  plans, and so forth.  But little by little, our \\ncommunication deepened and we began to talk more and more about our intern al worlds -- about our \\nupbringing, our scripting, our feelings, and self-d oubts.  As we were deeply immersed in these \\ncommunications, we also observed them and observed ourselves in them. We began to use that space \\nbetween stimulus and response in some new and inte resting ways which caused us to think about how \\nwe were programmed and how those programs shaped how we saw the world. \\nWe began an exciting adventure into our interi or worlds and found it to be more exciting, more \\nfascinating, more absorbing, more compelling, more  filled with discovery and insight than anything \\nwe\\'d even known in the outside world. \\nIt wasn\\'t all \"sweetness and light.\" We occasi onally hit some raw nerves and had some painful \\nexperiences, embarrassing experiences, self-revealing experiences -- experiences that made us extremely \\nopen and vulnerable to each other. And yet we foun d we had been wanting to go into those things for \\nyears. When we did go into the deep er, more tender issues and then ca me out of them, we felt in some \\nway healed. \\nWe were so initially supportive and helpful, so  encouraging and empathic to each other, that we \\nnurtured and facilitated these internal discoveries in each other. \\nWe gradually evolved two unspoken ground rule s. The first was \"no probing.\" As soon as we \\nunfolded the inner layers of vulnerability, we were no t to question each other, only to empathize. \\nProbing was simply too invasive. It was also too controlling and too logical. We were covering new, \\ndifficult terrain that was scary and uncertain, and it  stirred up fears and doubts. We wanted to cover \\nmore and more of it, but we grew to respect the n eed to let each other open up in our own time. \\nThe second ground rule was that when it hurt too much, when it was painful, we would simply quit \\nfor the day. Then we would either begin the next day where we left off or wait until the person who \\nwas sharing felt ready to continue. We carried aro und the loose ends, knowing that we wanted to deal \\nwith them. But because we had th e time and the environment conduc ive to it, and because we were so \\nexcited to observe our own involvement and to grow  within our marriage, we simply knew that sooner \\nor later we would deal with all those loose ends and bring them to some kind of closure. \\nThe most difficult, and eventua lly the most fruitful part of this kind of communication came when \\nmy vulnerability and Sandra\\'s vulnerability touched. Then, because of our subjective involvement, we found that the space between stimulus  and response was no longer there. A few bad feelings surfaced. \\nBut our deep desire and our implicit agreement was to prepare ourselves to st art where we left off and \\ndeal with those feelings until we resolved them. \\nOne of those difficult times had to do with a ba sic tendency in my person ality. My father was a \\nvery private individual -- very controlled and very careful. My mother was and is very public, very \\nopen, very spontaneous. I find both sets of tend encies in me, and when I feel insecure, I tend to \\nbecome private, like my father. I live inside myself and safely observe.

We had gone through many \\nexperiences over the years in which I felt her ope nness was inappropriate, and she felt my constraint \\nwas dysfunctional, both socially and to me as an individual because I would become insensitive to the \\nfeelings of others. All of this and much more came out during thos e deep visits. I came to value \\nSandra\\'s insight and wisdom and the way she helped me  to be a more open, gi ving, sensitive, social \\nperson. \\nAnother of those difficult times had to do with  what I perceived to be a \"hang up\" Sandra had which \\nhad bothered me for years. She seemed to have an  obsession about Frigidaire appliances which I was \\nat an absolute loss to understand. She would not ev en consider buying another brand of appliance. \\nEven when we were just starting out and on a very tight budget, she insisted that we drive the fifty \\nmiles to the \"big city\" where Frigidaire appliances  were sold, simply because no dealer in our small \\nuniversity town carried them at that time. \\nThis was a matter of considerable agitation to me. Fortunately, the situation came up only when \\nwe purchased an appliance. But when it did come up , it was like a stimulus that triggered off a hot \\nbutton response. This single issue seemed to be sy mbolic of all irrational thinking, and it generated a \\nwhole range of negative feelings within me. \\nI usually resorted to my dysfunctional private behavior.  I suppose I figu red that the only way I \\ncould deal with it was not to deal with it; otherwise,  I felt I would lose control and say things I shouldn\\'t \\nsay. There were times when I did slip and say something negative, and I had to go back and \\napologize. \\nWhat bothered me the most was not that she liked  Frigidaire, but that she persisted in making what \\nI considered utterly illogical and indefensible statemen ts to defend Frigidaire wh ich had no basis in fact \\nwhatsoever. If she had only agreed that her resp onse was irrational and purely emotional, I think I \\ncould have handled it. But her justification was upsetting. \\nIt was sometime in early spring when the Frig idaire issue came up. All our prior communication \\nhad prepared us. The ground rules had been deeply established -- not to probe and to leave it alone if \\nit got to be too painful for either or both. \\nI will never forget the day we talked it through. We didn\\'t end up on the beach that day; we just \\ncontinued to ride through the canefields, perhaps becaus e we didn\\'t want to look each other in the eye. \\nThere had been so much psychic hist ory and so many bad feelings associ ated with the issue, and it had \\nbeen submerged for so long. It had never been so critical as to rupture the relationship, but when \\nyou\\'re trying to cultivate a beautiful unified re lationship, any divisive issue is important. \\nSandra and I were amazed at what we learned through the interaction. It was truly synergistic. It \\nwas as if Sandra were learning, almost for the first ti me herself, the reason for her so-called hang-up. \\nShe started to talk about her father, about how he had worked as a high school history teacher and \\ncoach for years, and how, to help make ends meet, he  had gone into the appliance business. During an \\neconomic downturn, he had experien ced serious financial difficulties, and the only thing that enabled \\nhim to stay in business during that time was the fact that Frigidaire would finance his inventory. \\nSandra had an unusually deep and sweet relationsh ip with her father. When  he returned home at \\nthe end of a very tiring day, he wo uld lie on the couch, and Sandra woul d rub his feet and sing to him. \\nIt was a beautiful time they enjoye d together almost daily for years. He would also open up and talk \\nthrough his worries and concerns about the business, and he shared with Sand ra his deep appreciation \\nfor Frigidaire financing his inventory so that he could make it through the difficult times. \\nThis communication between father and daught er had taken place in a spontaneous way during \\nvery natural time, when the most powerful kind of scripting takes place. During those relaxed times \\nguards are down and all kinds of images and thoughts are planted deep in the subc onscious mind. \\nPerhaps Sandra had forgotten about all of this until the safety of that year of communication when it \\ncould come out also in very natural and spontaneous ways.

I also gained insight and a whole new level of respect. I came to realize that Sandra \\nwasn\\'t talking about appliances; she was talking abou t her father, and about loyalty -- about loyalty to \\nhis needs. \\nI  r e m e m b e r  b o t h  o f  u s  b e c o m i n g  t e a r f u l  o n  t h a t  d a y ,  n o t  s o  m u c h  b e c a u s e  o f  t h e  i n s i g h t s ,  b u t \\nbecause of the increased sense of reverence we had fo r each other. We discovered that even seemingly \\ntrivial things often have roots in d eep emotional experiences. To deal  only with the superficial trivia \\nwithout seeing the deeper, more tender issues is to  trample on the sacred ground of another\\'s heart. \\nThere were many rich fruits of those months .  Our communication beca me so powerful that we \\ncould almost instantly connect wi th each other\\'s thoughts. When  we left Hawaii, we resolved to \\ncontinue the practice. During the many years sinc e, we have continued to go regularly on our Honda \\ntrail cycle, or in the car if the weather\\'s bad, just to talk. We feel the key to st aying in love is to talk, \\nparticularly about feelings. We try to communicate  with each other several times every day, even \\nwhen I\\'m traveling. It\\'s like touching in to home  base, which accesses all the happiness, security, and \\nvalues it represents. \\nThomas Wolfe was wrong. You can go home ag ain -- if your home is a treasured relationship, a \\nprecious companionship. \\nIntergenerational Living \\nAs Sandra and I discovered that wonderful year, the ability to use wisely the gap between stimulus \\nand response, to exercise the four unique endowm ents of our human nature, empowered us from the \\nInside-Out. \\n   We had tried the outside-in approach.  We  loved each other, and we had attempted to work \\nthrough our differences by controlling our attitudes and our behaviors, by practicing useful techniques \\nof human interaction. But our band-aids and aspirin only lasted so long. Until we worked and \\ncommunicated on the level of our essential paradigms , the chronic underlying problems were still there. \\nWhen we began to work from the Inside-Out, we were able to build a relationship of trust and \\nopenness and to resolve dysfunctional differences in  a deep and lasting way that never could have \\ncome by working from the outside in. The delicious fruits -- a ri ch win-win relationship, a deep \\nunderstanding of each other, and a marvelous sy nergy -- grew out of the roots we nurtured as we \\nexamined our programs, rescripted ourselves, and ma naged our lives so that we could create time for \\nthe important Quadrant II activity of co mmunicating deeply with each other. \\nAnd there were other fruits. We were able to see on a much deeper level th at, just as powerfully as \\nour own lives had been affected by our parents, the lives of our children were being influenced and \\nshaped by us, often in ways we didn \\'t even begin to realize. Understanding the power of scripting in \\nour own lives, we felt a renewed desire to do ever ything we could to make certain that what we passed \\non to future generations, by both precept an d example, was based on correct principles. \\n   I have drawn particular attention in this b ook to those scripts we have been given which we \\nproactively want to change. But as we examine our scripting carefully, many of us will also begin to \\nsee beautiful scripts, positive scripts that have been  passed down to us which we have blindly taken for \\ngranted. Real self-awareness helps us to apprecia te those scripts and to appreciate those who have \\ngone before us and nurtured us in principle-based living, mirroring back to us not only what we are, \\nbut what we can become. \\nThere is transcendent power in a strong interg enerational family.  An effectively interdependent \\nfamily of children, parents, grandparents, aunts, un cles, and cousins can be a powerful force in helping \\npeople have a sense of who they are and wher e they came from and what they stand for. \\nIt\\'s great for children to be able to identify th emselves with the \"tribe,\" to feel that many people '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 161}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nknow them and care about them, even though they\\'re spread all over the country. And that can be a \\ntremendous benefit as you nurture your family. If one of your children is having difficulty and doesn\\'t \\nreally relate with you at a particular time in his life,  maybe he can relate to yo ur brother or sister who \\ncan become a surrogate father or mother, a mentor, or a hero for a period of time. \\nGrandparents who show a great interest in thei r grandchildren are among th e most precious people \\non this earth. What a marvelous positive social mi rror they can be! My mother is like that. Even \\nnow, in her late 80s, she takes a deep personal intere st in every one of her descendants. She writes us \\nlove letters. I was reading one the other day on a plane with tears streaming down my cheeks. I \\ncould call her up tonight and I know she\\'d say, \"Ste phen, I want you to know how much I love you \\nand how wonderful I think you are.\" She\\'s constantly reaffirming. \\nA strong intergenerational family is potentially one of the most fruitful, rewarding, and satisfying \\ninterdependent relationships. And many people feel the importance of that relationship. Look at the \\nfascination we all had with Roots some years ago. Each of us has roots and the ability to trace those \\nroots, to identify our ancestors. \\n   The highest and most powerful motivation in doing that is no t for ourselves only, but for our \\nposterity, for the posterity of all mankind. As someone once observed, \"The re are only two lasting \\nbequests we can give our children -- one is roots, the other wings.\" \\nBecoming a Transition Person \\nAmong other things, I believe that giving \"win gs\" to our children and to others means empowering \\nthem with the freedom to rise above negative scripti ng that had been passed do wn to us. I believe it \\nmeans becoming what my friend and associate, Dr. Terry Warner, calls a \"transition\" person. Instead of transferring those scripts to the next generatio n, we can change them. And we can do it in a way \\nthat will build relationships in the process \\nIf your parents abused you as a child, that does not mean that you have to abuse your own children. \\nYet there\\'s plenty of evidence to indicate that you w ill tend to live out that script. But because you\\'re \\nproactive, you can rewrite the script. You can choose not only not to abuse your children, but to affirm them, to script them in positive ways. \\nYou can write it in your personal mission statement and into your mind and heart. You can \\nvisualize yourself living in harmony with that missi on statement in your Daily Private Victory. You \\ncan take steps to love and forgive your own parents, and if they are still living, to build a positive relationship with them by seeking to understand. \\nA tendency that\\'s run through your family for generations can stop with you. You\\'re a transition \\nperson -- a link between the past and the future. And your own change can affect many, many lives \\ndownstream. \\n   One powerful transition person of  the twentieth century, Anwar Sadat, left us as part of his legacy a \\nprofound understanding of the nature of change. Sadat stood between a past that had created a \"huge \\nwall of suspicion, fear, hate and misunderstanding \" between Arabs and Israe lis, and a future in which \\nincreased conflict and isolation seemed inevitable. Ef forts at negotiation had been met with objections \\non every scale -- even to formalities and procedural points, to an insignificant comma or period in the \\ntext of proposed agreements. \\nWhile others attempted to resolve the tense situation by hacking at the leaves, Sadat drew upon his \\nearlier centering experience in a lonely prison cell and went to work on the r oot. And in doing so, he \\nchanged the course of hist ory for millions of people. \\nHe records in his autobiography: \\nIt was then that I drew, almo st unconsciously, on the inner stre ngth I had developed in Cell 54 of \\nCairo Central Prison -- a strength, call it a talent or  capacity, for change. I found that I faced a highly '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 162}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\ncomplex situation, and that I couldn\\'t hope to chan ge it until I had armed myself with the necessary \\npsychological and intellectual capacity. My contemplation of life and human nature in that secluded \\nplace had taught me that he who cannot change the very fabric of his thought will never be able to \\nchange reality, and will never, therefore, make any progress. \\nChange -- real change -- comes from the Inside-Out. It doesn\\'t come from hacking at the leaves of \\nattitude and behavior with quick-fix personality ethic techniques. It comes from striking at the root -\\xadthe fabric of our thought, the fundamental, essentia l paradigms, which give definition to our character \\nand create the lens through which we s ee the world. In the words of Amiel: \\nMoral truth can be conceived in thought. One ca n have feelings about it. One can will to live it. \\nBut moral truth may have been penetrated and possesse d in all these ways, and escape us still. Deeper \\neven than consciousness there is ou r being itself -- our very substance,  our nature. Only those truths \\nwhich have entered into this last region, which have become ourselves, become spontaneous and \\ninvoluntary as well as voluntary, unconscious as well as  conscious, are really our life -- that is to say, \\nsomething more than property. So long as we are  able to distinguish any space whatever between \\nTruth and us we remain outside it. The thought, the feeling, the desire or th e consciousness of life may \\nnot be quite life. To become divine  is then the aim of life. Then on ly can truth be said to be ours \\nbeyond the possibility of loss. It is no longer outsid e us, nor in a sense even in us, but we are it, and it \\nis we. \\nAchieving unity -- oneness -- with ourselves, with our loved ones, with our friends and working \\nassociates, is the highest and best and most delicious fruit of the Seven Habits. Most of us have tasted \\nthis fruit of true unity from time to time in the pa st, as we have also tasted the bitter, lonely fruit of \\ndisunity -- and we know how precious and fragile unity is. \\nObviously building character of total integrity and li ving the life of love and service that creates such \\nunity isn\\'t easy. It isn\\'t quick fix. \\nBut it\\'s possible. It begins with the desire to center our lives on correct principles, to break out of \\nthe paradigms created by other centers an d the comfort zones of unworthy habits. \\nSometimes we make mistakes, we feel awkward. But if we start with the Daily Private Victory and \\nwork from the Inside-Out, the resu lts will surely come. As we plant the seed and patiently weed and \\nnourish it, we begin to feel the excitement of re al growth and eventually taste the incomparably \\ndelicious fruits of a congruent, effective life. \\nAgain, I quote Emerson: \"That which we persist in  doing becomes easier -- not that the nature of the \\ntask has changed, but our ability to do has increased.\" \\n   B y  c e n t e r i n g  o u r  l i v e s  o n  c o r r e c t  p r i n c i p l e s  and creating a balanced  focus between doing and \\nincreasing our ability to do, we become empowered in  the task of creating effective, useful, and \\npeaceful lives...for ourselves, and for our posterity. \\nA Personal Note \\nAs I conclude this book, I would like to share my  own personal conviction concerning what I believe \\nto be the source of correct principles. I believe that correct principles are na tural laws, and that God, \\nthe Creator and Father of us all, is the source of th em, and also the source of our conscience. I believe \\nthat to the degree people live by this inspired consci ence, they will grow to fu lfill their natures; to the \\ndegree that they do not, they will not rise above the animal plane. \\nI believe that there are parts to human nature  that cannot be reached by either legislation or \\neducation, but require the power of God to deal with. I believe that as human beings, we cannot \\nperfect ourselves. To the degree to which we align ourselves with corre ct principles, divine \\nendowments will be released within our nature in en abling us to fulfill the measure of our creation.

You are about to \\nbegin an average day at the office, and as you look over the items to attend to that day, you estimate the \\namount of time each one will take. \\nYour unprioritized list includes the following: \\n1. You\\'d like to have lunch with the general manager (1-1 1/2 hours). \\n2. You were instructed the day before to prepare  your media budget for th e following year (2 or 3 \\ndays). \\n3. Your \"IN\" basket is overflowing into your \"OUT\" basket (1-1 1/2 hours). \\n4. You need to talk to the sales manager about last month\\'s sales; his offi ce is down the hall (4 \\nhours). \\n5. You have several items of correspondence that your secretary says are urgent (1 hour). \\n6. You\\'d like to catch up on the medical journals piled upon your desk (1/2 hour). \\n7. You need to prepare a presentation for a sales meeting slated for next month (2 hours). \\n8. There\\'s a rumor that the last batc h of product X didn\\'t pass quality control. \\n9. Someone from the FDA wants you to return his call about product X (1/2 hour). \\n10. There is a meeting at 2 P.M. for the execut ive board, but you don\\'t know what it is about (1 \\nhour). \\nTake a few minutes now and use what you have learned from Habits 1, 2, and 3 that might help you \\nto effectively schedule your day. \\nBy asking you to plan only one day, I have automatically elimin ated the wider context of the week \\nso fundamental to fourth generation time management. But you will be able to see the power of Quadrant II, principle-centered paradigm even in the context of one nine-hour period of time \\nIt is fairly obvious that most of the items on the list are Quadrant I activities. With the exception of \\nitem number six -- catching up on medical journals -- everything else is seemingly both important and '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 168}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nurgent. \\nIf you were a third-generation time manager, using prioritized values and goals, you would have a \\nframework for making such scheduling decisions and wo uld perhaps assign a letter such as A, B, or C \\nnext to each item and then number 1, 2, 3 under ea ch A, B, and C. You would also consider the \\ncircumstances, such as the availability of other people  involved, and the logical amount of time required \\nto eat lunch. Finally, based on all of these factors, you would schedule the day. \\n   Many third-generation time mana gers who have done this exercise do exactl y what I have described. \\nThey schedule when they will do what, and ba sed on various assumptions which are made and \\nexplicitly identified, they would accomplish or at leas t begin most of the items in that day and push the \\nremainder onto the next day or to some other time. \\nFor instance, most people indicate that they would use the time between 8 and 9 A.M. to find out \\nexactly what was on the agenda for the executive board meeting so that they could prepare for it, to set \\nup lunch with the general manager around noon, and to return the call from the FDA. They usually \\nplan to spend the next hour or two talking to th e sales manager, handling those correspondence items \\nwhich are most important and urgent , and checking out the rumor regarding the last batch of product X \\nwhich apparently didn\\'t pass quality control. The re st of that morning is spent in preparing for the \\nluncheon visit with the general manager and/or for th e 2 P.M. executive board meeting, or dealing with \\nwhatever problems were uncovered regarding product X and last month\\'s sales. \\n   After lunch, the afte rnoon is usually spent attending to th e unfinished matters just mentioned \\nand/or attempting to finish the other most im portant and urgent correspondence, making some \\nheadway into the overflowing \"IN\" basket, and hand ling other important and urgent items that may \\nhave come up during the course of the day. \\nMost people feel the media budget preparatio ns for the following year and the preparation for the \\nnext month\\'s sales meeting could probably be put of f until another day, which may not have as many \\nQuadrant I items in it. Both of those are obviousl y more Quadrant II activities, having to do with \\nlong-term thinking and planning. The medical jour nals continue to be set aside because they are \\nclearly Quadrant II and are probably less import ant than the other two Quadrant II matters just \\nmentioned. \\nWhat approach did you take as you scheduled those items? Was it similar to the third-generation \\napproach? Or did you take a Quadrant II, fourth-gen eration approach? (refer to the Time Management \\nMatrix on page 151). \\nThe Quadrant II Approach \\nLet\\'s go through the items on the list using a Quadrant II approach. This is only one possible \\nscenario; others could be created, which may also be  consistent with the Quadrant II paradigm, but this \\nis illustrative of the kind of thinking it embodies. \\nAs a Quadrant II manager, you would recognize that most P activities are in Quadrant I and most \\nPC activities are in Quadrant II. You would know that the only way to make Quadrant I manageable \\nis to give considerable attention to Quadrant II, primarily by working on prevention and opportunity \\nand by having the courage to sa y \"no\" to Quadrants III and IV. \\n   The 2:00 P.M. board meeting.  We will assume the 2 P.M. executive board meeting did not have an \\nagenda for the attending executives, or perhaps you would not see the agenda until you arrived at the \\nmeeting. This is not uncommon. As a result, people tend to come unprepared and to \"shoot from the \\nhip.\" Such meetings are usually disorganized and fo cus primarily on Quadrant I issues which are both \\nimportant and urgent, and around which there is ofte n a great deal of sharing of ignorance. These \\nmeetings generally result in wasted time and inferior  results and are often little more than an ego trip '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 169}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nfor the executive in charge. \\nIn most meetings, Quadrant II items are usually  categorized as \"other business.\" Because \"work \\nexpands to fill the time allotted for its completion\" in accordance with Parkinson\\'s Law, there usually \\nisn\\'t time to discuss them. If there is, people have been so beaten and smashed by Quadrant I, they \\nhave little or no energy left to address them. \\nSo you might move into Quadrant II by first atte mpting to get yourself on the agenda so that you \\ncan make a presentation regarding how to optimize the value of executive board meetings. You might \\nalso spend an hour or two in the morning preparing for that presentati on, even if you are only allowed \\na few minutes to stimulate everyone\\'s interest in hearing a more extended preparation at the next board meeting. This presentation woul d focus on the importance of al ways having a clearly specified \\npurpose for each meeting and a well-thought-out agen da to which each person  at the meeting has had \\nthe opportunity to contribute. The final agenda wo uld be developed by the chairman of the executive \\nboard and would focus first in Quadrant II issues that usually require more cr eative thinking rather \\nthan Quadrant I issues that generally  involve more mechanical thinking. \\nThe presentation would also stress the impo rtance of having minutes sent out immediately \\nfollowing the meeting, specifying assignments given and dates of accountability. These items would \\nthen be placed on appropriate futur e agendas which would be sent out in plenty of time for others to \\nprepare to discuss them. \\nNow this is what might be done by looking at  one item on the schedule -- the 2 P.M. executive \\nboard meeting -- through a Quadrant II frame of referenc e. This requires a high level of proactivity, \\nincluding the courage to challenge th e assumption that you even need to schedule the items in the first \\nplace. It also requires consideration in order to avoid the kind of crisis atmosphere that often \\nsurrounds a board meeting. \\nAlmost every other item on the list can be a pproached with the same Quadrant II thinking, with \\nperhaps the exception of the FDA call. \\n   Returning the FDA call.  Based on the background  of the quality of the relationship with the FDA, \\nyou make that call in the morning so that whatever it reveals can be dealt with appropriately. This \\nmight be difficult to delegate, since another organizat ion is involved that may have a Quadrant I culture \\nand an individual who wants you, an d not some delegatee, to respond. \\nWhile you may attempt to directly influence th e culture of your own organization as a member of \\nthe executive board, your Circle of Influence is probab ly not large enough to really influence the culture \\nof the FDA, so you simply comply with the request. If you find the nature of the problem uncovered \\nin the phone call is persistent or chronic, then you may approach it from a Quadrant II mentality in an \\neffort to prevent such problems in the future. Th is again would require considerable proactivity to \\nseize the opportunity to transform the quality of th e relationship with the FDA or to work on the \\nproblems in a preventive way. \\nLunch with the general manager. You might s ee having lunch with the general manager as a rare \\nopportunity to discuss some longer-range, Quadrant II matters in a fairly informal atmosphere. This \\nmay also take 30 to 60 minutes in the morning to adequately prepare for, or you may simply decide to have a good social interaction and listen carefully, perhaps without any plan at all. Either possibility may present a good opportunity to build yo ur relationship with the general manager. \\n   Preparing the media budget.  Regarding item nu mber two, you might call in two or three of your \\nassociates most directly connected to media budget preparation and ask them to bring their \\nrecommendations in the form of \"com pleted staff work\" (which may only require your initials to finally \\napprove) or perhaps to outline two or three well-th ought-out options you can choose from and identify \\nthe consequences of each option. This may take a full hour sometime during the day -- to go over \\ndesired results, guidelines, resources, accountability, and consequences. But by  investing the one hour, \\nyou tap the best thinking of concerned people who ma y have different points of view. If you haven\\'t '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 170}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\ntaken this approach before, you may need to spend more time to train them in what this approach \\ninvolves, what \"completed staff work\" means, how to synergize around differences and what \\nidentifying alternative options and consequences involves. \\n   The \"In\" basket and correspondence.  Instead of  diving into the \"IN\" ba sket, you would spend some \\ntime, perhaps 30 to 60 minutes, beginning a training pr ocess with your secretary so that he or she could \\ngradually become empowered to handle the \"IN\" ba sket as well as the correspondence under item \\nnumber five. This training program might go on fo r several weeks, even mont hs, until your secretary \\nor assistant is really capable of being results-minded rather than methods-minded. \\nYour secretary could be trained to go through all correspondence items and all \"IN\" basket items, to \\nanalyze them and to handle as many as possible. Items that could not be handled with confidence \\ncould be carefully organized, prioritized, and brough t to you with a recommendation or a note for your \\nown action. In this way, within a few months your secretary or executive assi stant could hand 80 to 90 \\npercent of all the \"IN\" basket items and correspond ence, often much better than you could handle them \\nyourself, simply because your mind is so focused on Quadrant II opportunities instead of buried in \\nQuadrant I problems. \\nThe sales manager and last month\\'s sales. A possible Quadrant II approach to item number four \\nwould be to think through the entire relationship and performance agreement with that sales manager \\nto see if the Quadrant II approach is being used. The exercise doesn\\'t indicate what you need to talk to \\nthe sales manager about, but assuming it\\'s a Quad rant I item, you could take the Quadrant II approach \\nand work on the chronic nature of the problem as well as the Quadrant I approach to solve the \\nimmediate need. \\nPossibly you could train your secretary to hand le the matter without your involvement and bring to \\nyour attention only that which you need to be aw are of. This may involve some Quadrant II activity \\nwith your sales manager and others reporting to you so they understand that your primary function is \\nleadership rather than management.  They can begi n to understand that they can actually solve the \\nproblem better with your secretary than with you,  and free you for Quadrant II leadership activity. \\nIf you feel that the sales manager might be offend ed by having your secretary make the contact, then \\nyou could begin the process of building that relationsh ip so that you can eventu ally win the confidence \\nof the sales manager toward your both taki ng a more beneficial Quadrant II approach. \\nCatching up on medical journals. Reading medical journals is a Quadrant II item you may want to \\nprocrastinate. But your own long-term professional competence and confidence may largely be a \\nfunction of staying abreast of this literature. So, you may decide to put the subject on the agenda for \\nyour own staff meeting, where you could suggest th at a systematic approach to reading the medical \\njournals be set up among your staff. Members of the staff could study differe nt journals and teach the \\nrest the essence of what they learn  at future staff meetings. In addi tion, they could supply others with \\nkey articles or excerpts which everyone really needs to read and understand. \\nPreparing for next month\\'s sales meeting. Re garding item number seven, a possible Quadrant II \\napproach might be to call together a small group of  the people who report to you and charge them to \\nmake a thorough analysis of the needs of the salesp eople. You could assign them to bring a completed \\nstaff work recommendation to you be a specified da te within a week or 10 days, giving you enough \\ntime to adapt it and have it implemented. This ma y involve their interviewing each of the salespeople \\nto discover their real concerns and needs, or it mi ght involve sampling the sales group so that the sales \\nmeeting agenda is relevant and is sent out in pl enty of time so that the salespeople can prepare and \\nget involved in it in appropriate ways. \\nRather than prepare the sales meeting yourself, you could delegate that task to a small group of \\npeople who represent different points of view and di fferent kinds of sales problems. Let them interact \\nconstructively and creatively and bring to you a finish ed recommendation. If they are not used to this \\nkind of assignment, you may spend some of that m eeting challenging and training them, teaching them '), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/7habits.pdf', 'page': 171}, page_content='T H E S E V E N H A B I T S O F H I G H L Y E F F E C T I V E P E O P L E B r o u g h t t o y o u b y F l y H e a r t \\nwhy you are using this approach and how it will bene fit them as well. In doing so, you are beginning \\nto train your people to think long-term, to be re sponsible for completing staff work or other desired \\nresults, to creatively interact with each other in interdependent ways, and to do a quality job within \\nspecified deadlines. \\nProduct \"X\" and quality control. Now let\\'s look  at item number eight regarding product \"X,\" which \\ndidn\\'t pass quality control. The Quadrant II approach would be to study that problem to see if it has a \\nchronic or persistent dimension to it. If so, you co uld delegate to others the careful analysis of that \\nchronic problem with instructions to bring to you a recommendation, or perhaps simply to implement \\nwhat they come up with and inform you of the results. \\nThe net effect of this Quadrant II day at the o f f i c e  i s  t h a t  y o u  a r e  s p e n d i n g  m o s t  o f  y o u r  t i m e \\ndelegating, training, preparing a board presentation , making one phone call, and having a productive \\nlunch. By taking a long-term PC approach, hopefu lly in a matter of a few weeks, perhaps months, you \\nwon\\'t face such a Quadrant I scheduling problem again. \\nAs you go through this analysis, you may be th inking this approach seems idealistic. You may be \\nwondering if Quadrant II managers ever work in Quadran t I. I admit it is idealistic. This book is not \\nabout the habits of highly ineffective people; it\\'s ab out habits of highly effective people. And to be \\nhighly effective is an ideal to work toward. \\nOf course you\\'ll need to spend time in Qu adrant I.  Even the best -laid plans in Quadrant II \\nsometimes aren\\'t realized. But Quadrant I can be significantly reduced into more manageable \\nproportions so that you\\'re not always into the stressf ul crisis atmosphere that negatively affects your \\njudgment as well as your health. \\nUndoubtedly it will take considerable patience and persistence, and you may not be able to take a \\nQuadrant II approach to all or even most of these item s at this time. But if you can begin to make some \\nheadway on a few of them and help create more of a Quadrant II mind-set in other people as well as \\nyourself, then downstream there will be quantum improvements in performance. \\nAgain, I acknowledge that in a family setting or  a small business setting, such delegation may not be \\npossible. But this does not preclude a Quadrant II mind-set which would produce interesting and \\ncreative ways within your Circle of Influence to  reduce the size of Quadrant I crises through the \\nexercise of Quadrant II initiative. \\nSky, Land , River . \\n'), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/goodToGreat.pdf', 'page': 0}, page_content=''), Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs/goodToGreat.pdf', 'page':
